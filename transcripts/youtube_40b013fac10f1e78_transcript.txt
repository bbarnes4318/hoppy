=== FULL TRANSCRIPT WITH TIMESTAMPS ===

[00:00 - 00:04] Happy Monday, everyone. Welcome back to Final Expense Teller Sales. My name is Dana Neeson.
[00:04 - 00:12] It has been two years since I posted my original seven-part sales series on breaking down the sales process.
[00:13 - 00:20] At that time, I was running a different agency with a different team representing one carrier,
[00:20 - 00:26] and things have changed. I am now on the broker side running my own agency,
[00:26 - 00:30] Empower Life Group, and representing multiple carriers.
[00:30 - 00:38] And so I thought, what better way than to reintroduce this series than now?
[00:38 - 00:46] But not only am I going to be revamping the original seven part sales series, I'm adding
[00:46 - 00:49] three additional sections.
[00:49 - 00:57] So this new revised improved sales series is a 10-part sales series.
[00:57 - 01:01] We're going to cover the opener this time.
[01:01 - 01:04] We're going to, of course, continue with discovery.
[01:04 - 01:08] We're going to do credibility and education as one section.
[01:08 - 01:11] We're going to find the need.
[01:11 - 01:13] We're going to do underwriting this time.
[01:13 - 01:19] We're going to talk about quoting and how you should quote people.
[01:19 - 01:22] we're going to, of course, cover objection handling.
[01:22 - 01:25] We're going to talk about writing the application
[01:25 - 01:28] and best practices to do that.
[01:28 - 01:31] We're also gonna be talking about the cooldown,
[01:31 - 01:33] which is probably the most underlook
[01:33 - 01:36] to underutilize part of the sales process.
[01:36 - 01:40] And then we are going to end this series with follow up.
[01:40 - 01:44] Now, if you stick with all 10 of these,
[01:44 - 01:47] you will be so incredibly equipped
[01:47 - 01:50] to handle your clients from hello,
[01:50 - 01:53] to congratulations and beyond.
[01:53 - 01:55] What I've found from two years ago,
[01:55 - 01:57] if you go back and look at the series,
[01:57 - 02:02] is we have a huge audience in the first video,
[02:03 - 02:06] second video, and then it slowly drops off.
[02:06 - 02:07] I'm doing a training right now
[02:07 - 02:12] with Danielle Delgado for mindset and human behavior.
[02:12 - 02:15] And she said something that rings so true
[02:15 - 02:18] to what I typically see in this space.
[02:18 - 02:23] Human beings are absolutely great starters,
[02:23 - 02:26] but we are terrible finishers.
[02:26 - 02:28] So don't be in that statistic.
[02:28 - 02:31] Don't be a great starter and start a series,
[02:31 - 02:33] and then taper off in the end,
[02:33 - 02:36] and think you don't need every single part.
[02:36 - 02:40] I want to challenge you as you go through this new series
[02:40 - 02:45] with me to be just as engaged in video one and video two,
[02:45 - 02:49] as you are in video 6, as you are in video 10.
[02:49 - 02:51] Stick with it.
[02:51 - 02:55] Post a comment every single time to not just hold yourself
[02:55 - 02:58] accountable, but let this community know that you're here
[02:58 - 03:00] and let me know that you're engaged.
[03:00 - 03:05] As always, give this video a like if you find value to it.
[03:05 - 03:09] And if you want to learn more about how to join my team
[03:09 - 03:12] at Empower Life Group, we are bringing on agents
[03:12 - 03:13] every single week.
[03:13 - 03:18] We are looking for both agents license and unlicensed looking for an opportunity as well
[03:18 - 03:21] as leaders who are looking to better support their current teams.
[03:21 - 03:25] Now all of my contact information is in the description below.
[03:25 - 03:31] You can visit my website at EmpowerLifeGroup.com and today we are covering the opener.
[03:31 - 03:48] Alright, what you're looking at behind me is page one of the Empower Life Tele-Sales
[03:48 - 03:52] script for selling simplified issue life specifically final expense.
[03:52 - 03:54] one of this series is the opener.
[03:54 - 03:57] So we're going to cover five different objections
[03:57 - 04:00] that you typically get in the front end of the sale.
[04:00 - 04:03] We have the introduction and then we have bridge
[04:03 - 04:05] into the first question of discovery
[04:05 - 04:08] and that's what we're going to talk about today.
[04:10 - 04:13] The opener here, this is just one opener, right?
[04:13 - 04:15] You don't have to use this opener.
[04:15 - 04:19] You also don't have to use word for word for badam.
[04:19 - 04:22] The objection responses that we're going to talk
[04:22 - 04:27] about today, you should look at this as a guide and a skeleton and a road map to give you
[04:27 - 04:32] some confidence to start tackling these phone calls as you get them.
[04:32 - 04:38] I also want to touch on really quick something that we don't talk about enough, which is mindset
[04:38 - 04:43] and fear and feeling like you're not good enough and scared of the clients and worrying that
[04:43 - 04:47] you're not going to get a sale and investing in all of these leads and what if I don't get
[04:47 - 04:48] an ROI?
[04:48 - 04:53] know that all this stuff is happening behind the scenes as you are just trying to memorize
[04:53 - 05:01] a script. But I want to encourage you and remind you about one thing. The people that are receiving
[05:01 - 05:07] your call on the other end of the line are way more intimidated and afraid of you and
[05:07 - 05:13] of all the other people that are calling them. Right? What are they afraid of? Picture your
[05:13 - 05:19] avatar, picture your ideal client, and think about who you are calling, okay?
[05:19 - 05:26] You are calling people that are retired, that are living on a fixed income, that are afraid
[05:26 - 05:28] of getting taken advantage of.
[05:28 - 05:31] They're afraid of making the wrong choice, right?
[05:31 - 05:36] They're afraid of buying from the wrong person.
[05:36 - 05:37] They're afraid of getting scammed.
[05:37 - 05:42] They have all of their own fears going into the call.
[05:42 - 05:47] And if you bring your fears into the call of not getting the sale, of not knowing what
[05:47 - 05:52] to say, of stumbling over your words, those two fears are going to collide and you're
[05:52 - 05:55] not going to serve anybody.
[05:55 - 06:01] So you always remind yourself how lucky these people are to be on the phone with you, that
[06:01 - 06:06] you have an opportunity to help them understand something and clear the air behind something
[06:06 - 06:11] they feel completely overwhelmed and confused about.
[06:11 - 06:16] So don't let that phone be a 10,000 pound weight.
[06:16 - 06:20] Stop thinking about, you have to get a sale, you have to make money and start thinking
[06:20 - 06:26] about what can I say so that I have the opportunity to help someone.
[06:26 - 06:32] And once you can get through that clutter and get out of your own way and realize that
[06:32 - 06:38] we're just here to try to have a conversation and help one human to the next, that it starts
[06:38 - 06:40] to become a lot easier.
[06:40 - 06:44] Okay, so we're going to start with our opener here right at the top.
[06:44 - 06:54] They're going to answer the phone and you're going to assume the person who answered the phone is a person that inquired on the form and you're just going to say hi.
[06:54 - 06:57] Betty, right, hi, Betty.
[06:57 - 07:06] Hey, this is just Dana calling and I was calling about your request for information on the state regulated final expense plans here in California.
[07:06 - 07:10] I'm just here to help you understand your options and answer any questions you might
[07:10 - 07:12] have.
[07:12 - 07:13] That's it.
[07:13 - 07:15] That's your opener.
[07:15 - 07:23] And if they don't say anything for two to three seconds, you go right, you skip objections
[07:23 - 07:26] and you go right into this first line.
[07:26 - 07:29] And so before we get started, I do need to let you know that our call may be monitored or
[07:29 - 07:30] recorded.
[07:30 - 07:34] And of course, that's if you are calling on a recorded line, which we do.
[07:34 - 07:37] So we want to say that to state compliant.
[07:37 - 07:41] And I just want to confirm a couple of details so I can get this information out to you.
[07:41 - 07:46] I show here that you're in the state of California and your zip code is this.
[07:46 - 07:50] If you have zip code, you can show the amount of coverage they requested.
[07:50 - 07:52] You can verify beneficiary.
[07:52 - 07:54] You can say their email address.
[07:54 - 07:58] Whatever you have on your lead form, just feed back a couple pieces of information.
[07:58 - 08:02] You might even have a favorite food or a favorite hobby or a favorite color.
[08:02 - 08:06] some of those things to remind them of their inquiry.
[08:06 - 08:09] All correct, or did I get anything wrong, right?
[08:09 - 08:11] The positive or the negative.
[08:11 - 08:13] And then I bridge right into,
[08:13 - 08:15] and was this inquiry just for yourself,
[08:15 - 08:18] or was it for anyone else as well, okay?
[08:18 - 08:22] That's your introduction, assuming you get no objections.
[08:22 - 08:23] Which happens, right?
[08:23 - 08:26] If you are getting brand new leads
[08:26 - 08:28] that just came in in real time,
[08:28 - 08:31] you shouldn't be getting a significant amount
[08:31 - 08:39] objections like I didn't do that or I'm not interested but you will get
[08:39 - 08:43] objections right let's be honest and you'll probably get a lot of them the
[08:43 - 08:49] most common objection is this first one right here I don't have time I don't
[08:49 - 08:53] have time and why do people not have time because they just filled out the
[08:53 - 08:57] inquiry they should have nothing but time right even if they filled out the
[08:57 - 09:01] inquiry last night let me remind you that your prospects are not sitting by the
[09:01 - 09:05] phone waiting for their life insurance agent to call them to try to sell them on a policy.
[09:06 - 09:11] I also want to remind you that once somebody clicks on an ad on Facebook,
[09:12 - 09:18] they are now in the algorithm. That means that you're going to continue to be served ads
[09:18 - 09:23] from your competition. From so many people, they won't even remember which ad they clicked on
[09:23 - 09:29] to get to you. Okay, they're going to see things that are free. They're going to see things for
[09:29 - 09:36] state-approved burial plans. Your ad might be perfectly legit. Even the ads that you're buying,
[09:36 - 09:40] the leads you're buying from, if you're buying third-party leads. Their ads might be very
[09:41 - 09:47] very well written and they might have all the right expectations. But if you hear someone that says,
[09:47 - 09:52] you know, I thought it was free, don't freak out. Okay, that could just be someone else's ad.
[09:52 - 09:57] And that's a different objection. Let's focus on, I don't have time. Because if you're getting
[09:57 - 10:02] high-intent leads, the I don't have time objection will probably be your most common.
[10:02 - 10:10] So remember that naturally, we all have a little bit of sales resistance, okay.
[10:10 - 10:12] We are getting interrupted in our day.
[10:12 - 10:15] We didn't likely have an appointment.
[10:15 - 10:20] We've answered the phone out of slight curiosity, and now we've identified that it's a sales
[10:20 - 10:24] person on something we did inquire about, but do we want to have a conversation with them?
[10:24 - 10:31] I'd rather not, I'd rather go watch my TV show or go play bingo or call my grandkids
[10:31 - 10:34] or do whatever the last thing I want to do is talk to you.
[10:34 - 10:40] Okay, that's what's going through their mind in the 15 seconds that you gave them your
[10:40 - 10:41] introduction.
[10:41 - 10:47] So if you also sound like you don't care, if you also sound unsure of yourself, if you
[10:47 - 10:54] If you don't come in with confidence and volume, by the way, according to VINJANG, who
[10:54 - 11:02] is an expert on communication skills, most people speak in a range of 1 to 5.
[11:02 - 11:06] And most of us, when we're on the phones, we speak in a level 2 to 3.
[11:06 - 11:12] And if we come in with this uncertainty, hi, this is just Dana.
[11:12 - 11:17] And I was calling about your inquiry about the final expense plans.
[11:17 - 11:19] I'm here to ask you to understand your options
[11:19 - 11:21] and we end everything on an upswing,
[11:21 - 11:24] kind of like a question mark in the middle of our sentence,
[11:24 - 11:27] nobody's gonna want to talk to you.
[11:27 - 11:29] Okay, so not only do you have to practice the words,
[11:29 - 11:32] but you also have to practice how they're delivered
[11:32 - 11:35] to give people a reason to be curious enough
[11:35 - 11:37] to maybe stay on the phone with you,
[11:37 - 11:40] but you will get resistance.
[11:40 - 11:42] So when that person says, I don't have time
[11:42 - 11:45] and you see these words written above my head
[11:45 - 11:48] that says, you know, I understand I caught you at a bad time.
[11:48 - 11:50] Would you happen to just have one minute
[11:50 - 11:53] to see if it even makes sense to call you back later?
[11:53 - 11:56] You better get that out fast.
[11:56 - 11:59] And it doesn't have to be these exact words, right?
[11:59 - 12:01] That's another thing I want you to remember.
[12:01 - 12:05] Say this to where it feels like you're the one that wrote it
[12:05 - 12:08] and you're the one that said it, right?
[12:08 - 12:11] Sometimes I might even say, oh, that's not a problem.
[12:11 - 12:13] You know, would you happen to just have one minute
[12:13 - 12:16] to see if it even makes sense for me to call you back
[12:16 - 12:17] after work, right?
[12:17 - 12:19] If they gave me that,
[12:19 - 12:21] or they're on their way to a doctor appointment,
[12:21 - 12:24] no problem, I totally get it.
[12:24 - 12:26] Do you happen to just have one minute
[12:26 - 12:28] to see if it makes sense to call you back
[12:28 - 12:30] after your doctor appointment?
[12:30 - 12:34] So I'm not necessarily using the later phrase
[12:34 - 12:36] every single time because I'm listening,
[12:36 - 12:39] I'm actively listening to the words they're telling me
[12:39 - 12:41] and I'm responding accordingly.
[12:41 - 12:45] Also notice what two words did I emphasize
[12:45 - 12:48] in my response.
[12:48 - 12:50] I emphasize one minute,
[12:50 - 12:52] because that's what I want them to hear.
[12:52 - 12:54] If you study communication,
[12:54 - 12:57] you know that the words that we emphasize
[12:57 - 13:00] control what our clients hear and pay attention to,
[13:00 - 13:03] and we can kind of control how they respond
[13:03 - 13:06] based on what we emphasize.
[13:06 - 13:08] So I'm specifically emphasizing one minute.
[13:08 - 13:10] I'm also making it seem like,
[13:10 - 13:12] oh, it's no big deal that they don't have time.
[13:12 - 13:15] I hear that all the time.
[13:15 - 13:20] So I want to just buy another 30 seconds to a minute
[13:20 - 13:23] to try to see if this is a false objection.
[13:23 - 13:28] Because at least 50% of the time, it's a false objection.
[13:28 - 13:30] And if you can buy yourself 30 seconds to a minute
[13:30 - 13:33] and you can get somebody to lower their walls,
[13:33 - 13:37] 40 minutes later you will be finishing up an application.
[13:37 - 13:42] So do not let those people go, fight for the conversation.
[13:42 - 13:44] Like your life depends on it.
[13:44 - 13:47] Like, if you let that person off the phone,
[13:47 - 13:49] you will never be able to make another phone call again.
[13:49 - 13:53] If that's the mind trick, you have to play with yourself.
[13:53 - 13:56] How many times, if you answered a sales call
[13:56 - 13:57] or a telemarketing call,
[13:57 - 13:59] and you said I don't have time right now,
[13:59 - 14:03] and the other person on the phone doesn't even fight?
[14:03 - 14:05] They just say, okay, bye.
[14:05 - 14:06] Right?
[14:06 - 14:07] That is how we are trained.
[14:07 - 14:09] We're trained to say no,
[14:09 - 14:11] and for the other person on the other end of the line,
[14:11 - 14:13] to say, okay.
[14:13 - 14:16] But when that person says actually,
[14:16 - 14:18] Do you just have one minute to see if it even makes sense
[14:18 - 14:20] to call you back later?
[14:20 - 14:24] What you will find is most people will say, okay,
[14:24 - 14:27] most people will say, okay, you got one minute.
[14:27 - 14:29] Perfect, that's all I need.
[14:29 - 14:31] Hey, can I ask was this inquiry just for you
[14:31 - 14:33] or for someone else as well?
[14:33 - 14:35] Maybe verify some information
[14:35 - 14:37] and then we head into discovery,
[14:37 - 14:39] which we will talk about on the next call.
[14:39 - 14:42] Because there's many different ways to modify discovery
[14:42 - 14:46] depending upon how you entered the call.
[14:46 - 14:47] Okay, so I want you to think about right now,
[14:47 - 14:50] we're only talking about getting the chance
[14:50 - 14:52] to enter the call.
[14:52 - 14:54] And the I don't have time objection
[14:55 - 14:58] is should be your most common one
[14:58 - 15:01] if you're getting brand new high intent leads.
[15:01 - 15:06] Okay, let's move on to, I already took care of that.
[15:06 - 15:07] Okay, I already took care of that,
[15:07 - 15:09] which can be ambiguous.
[15:09 - 15:10] I already took care of that,
[15:10 - 15:11] could mean a lot of different things,
[15:11 - 15:15] but we're going to assume that I already took care
[15:15 - 15:17] it means they already purchased, okay?
[15:17 - 15:20] I mean, I'm making an assumption, that's my choice.
[15:20 - 15:23] And again, I act like it's no big deal, right?
[15:23 - 15:26] I don't let that affect me, right?
[15:26 - 15:27] Oh, that's not a problem.
[15:27 - 15:30] Hey, how long ago did you get that?
[15:30 - 15:32] If you watched my last seven part sales series,
[15:32 - 15:35] you'll know this probably sounds similar
[15:35 - 15:39] because why change something that works.
[15:39 - 15:42] We stay consistent all the time.
[15:42 - 15:44] We're not changing things up all the time.
[15:44 - 15:49] we're staying consistent and we don't deviate. That's how we can start to create control
[15:49 - 15:54] in our environment. Okay, hey, that's not a problem. How long ago did you get that? Oh,
[15:54 - 15:59] a week ago, oh a couple days ago, oh a month ago, whatever it is. Well, hey, you know, while
[15:59 - 16:04] I have you on the phone, would it be reasonable to offer you one more quote just to be sure
[16:04 - 16:09] you were offered the best policy available? Okay, now you have two different ways people
[16:09 - 16:14] can go. They can say sure and then of course we modify discovery which we'll
[16:14 - 16:18] talk about tomorrow or on the next video. I don't know if that's coming out
[16:18 - 16:26] tomorrow or they'll say no I'm good right so there's two different paths and of
[16:26 - 16:31] course we want them to say sure you can give me another quote if they say no well
[16:31 - 16:36] I try to double down which is not on the script but I do tend to double down
[16:36 - 16:42] and I'll say something like, well, it would be important for us to at least make sure you're not into your waiting period
[16:42 - 16:47] when you shouldn't be, or it lets at least take a moment to review your policy
[16:47 - 16:51] to make sure that you have the amount of coverage you need or that you're not overpaying
[16:51 - 16:56] because we see people overpaying all the time. It'll only take a couple of minutes.
[16:56 - 17:00] Right, just to get the opportunity to have the conversation.
[17:00 - 17:03] And I want you guys to remember that this is the point.
[17:03 - 17:09] Getting pass the opener does not guarantee that I'm going to even get through
[17:09 - 17:13] discovery. It certainly doesn't guarantee that I'm going to get to quote someone
[17:13 - 17:20] or get a sale. What this is doing is it's sharpening my sword, it's sharpening
[17:20 - 17:28] your sword so that you are in practice of rebutting and overcoming concerns and
[17:28 - 17:32] resistance so that when you do have the person that's giving you a false
[17:32 - 17:38] objection. You're Johnny on the spot. It just comes so natural to you that all the
[17:38 - 17:42] sudden you're in discovery, you're in education, you're in the application
[17:42 - 17:46] and you didn't even have to think about overcoming the objection because it's
[17:46 - 17:54] just what you do. Now notice how I said it right. We have something called
[17:54 - 17:59] interjection. I'm anticipating the objection when somebody's giving it to me. I
[17:59 - 18:04] I do not let them finish, and I do not create space.
[18:04 - 18:07] So when somebody says to me, I already took care of it, but thank you, though.
[18:07 - 18:10] I do not let them say thank you.
[18:10 - 18:16] I start talking louder over them where I said, most people speak at a two, three.
[18:16 - 18:18] I'm speaking at a level four, five.
[18:18 - 18:19] I'm commanding attention.
[18:19 - 18:22] I'm commanding the virtual space.
[18:22 - 18:28] And I'm having them stop to listen to me because I'm the expert and I'm the one that's
[18:28 - 18:29] here to help.
[18:29 - 18:33] Oh, I'm not interested. Oh, that's not a problem. How long ago did you get it?
[18:34 - 18:40] Well, you know, hey while I have you on the phone, you think it would be reasonable to just offer you one more quote
[18:40 - 18:43] just to be sure you were offered the best policy available.
[18:43 - 18:47] And these hand motions that I'm doing all over the place, it's not just for YouTube,
[18:47 - 18:54] it's not just for social media. I am actually doing this when I am on the phone with someone as if they were right in front of me.
[18:54 - 18:59] Because when I'm animated with my hands, when I'm animated with my face, when I'm sitting
[18:59 - 19:05] up with good posture, and I'm not slouched back, and I'm not just going through the motions,
[19:05 - 19:10] and looking for low hanging fruit, I will have more opportunity to connect with someone
[19:10 - 19:12] than you will.
[19:12 - 19:19] So we act like the person that is an expert at overcoming objections, right?
[19:19 - 19:27] We take up that space and we practice our craft and we deliver it in a way of the person
[19:27 - 19:29] that already does it.
[19:29 - 19:30] That's teaching it.
[19:30 - 19:34] So you're going to take your calls as if you were me, as if you had all the confidence
[19:34 - 19:39] in the world, as if you had already met, as if you had written these yourself.
[19:39 - 19:42] That is how you are going to behave when you take these calls.
[19:42 - 19:45] Alright, let's go to the next one.
[19:45 - 19:46] I'm not interested.
[19:46 - 19:50] Again, there's multiple ways you can handle these.
[19:50 - 19:54] There's multiple ways to overcome objections.
[19:54 - 19:56] These are just one way.
[19:56 - 20:01] We talk about lots of other ways on our daily training calls inside of Empower Life Group.
[20:01 - 20:06] Even my team doesn't follow these verbatim.
[20:06 - 20:08] We talk about lots of different variations.
[20:08 - 20:12] We have lots of leaders within the team that offer different suggestions or different ways
[20:12 - 20:13] to handle things.
[20:13 - 20:16] And that's some of the benefits that you get when you work and collaborate inside of
[20:16 - 20:17] a team.
[20:17 - 20:21] You're not just handcuffed to a script that has one option, but you get to hear multiple
[20:21 - 20:22] options.
[20:22 - 20:26] So this one option is, oh, again, oh, you know, that's not a problem or you're not interested
[20:26 - 20:30] because you found it was unaffordable or that you might not qualify.
[20:30 - 20:32] Okay.
[20:32 - 20:33] Very simple.
[20:33 - 20:36] They say it's not a, you know, it wasn't affordable.
[20:36 - 20:38] I'm so sorry to hear that.
[20:38 - 20:42] Like, you know, I specialize working with families on a fixed income.
[20:42 - 20:46] We can typically find good final expense plans under $50 a month.
[20:46 - 20:51] Is that something that feels unaffordable to you?
[20:51 - 20:53] You know, I don't think I can qualify.
[20:53 - 20:58] Well, you know, if it helps, we specialize working with families to get people
[20:58 - 21:01] qualified with a variety of health conditions.
[21:01 - 21:06] Can I ask what has you feeling concerned that you may not qualify?
[21:06 - 21:07] Right?
[21:07 - 21:09] Easy way to handle it.
[21:09 - 21:10] Next one.
[21:10 - 21:13] I don't remember filling this out.
[21:13 - 21:17] Now you're gonna get this because maybe it took you
[21:17 - 21:21] 10, 15 attempts to actually get a hold of your lead.
[21:21 - 21:23] Maybe they did forget, right?
[21:23 - 21:25] Maybe the person just inquired
[21:25 - 21:27] and did not want a phone call,
[21:27 - 21:28] and so they're using that as a reason
[21:28 - 21:31] to get you off of the phone.
[21:31 - 21:33] Not everybody's going to be honest and forthright
[21:33 - 21:34] with the fact that they clicked on something
[21:34 - 21:36] they wish they didn't.
[21:36 - 21:38] So keep that in mind as you're calling your leads.
[21:38 - 21:40] Now if you're calling aged leads,
[21:40 - 21:42] well you probably will get a lot of people
[21:42 - 21:44] let's say they don't remember.
[21:44 - 21:49] And maybe what you say has to circumvent that.
[21:49 - 21:53] Maybe you lead with the fact that maybe they don't remember.
[21:53 - 21:54] You know, I wouldn't expect you to remember
[21:54 - 21:57] because we got this inquiry some time ago.
[21:57 - 22:00] You know, maybe circumvent that ejection.
[22:00 - 22:02] I am not recommending that people on this team
[22:02 - 22:05] work age lead so we don't lead with our response
[22:05 - 22:07] about you may not remember.
[22:07 - 22:11] Someone says, I don't remember, I didn't do that.
[22:11 - 22:13] Right, you know, that's not uncommon.
[22:13 - 22:15] It looks like you may have clicked something on Facebook
[22:15 - 22:16] about protecting your family
[22:16 - 22:19] from out of pocket funeral expenses.
[22:19 - 22:23] I might even say you listed your daughter
[22:23 - 22:25] as your beneficiary and you were interested
[22:25 - 22:26] in $10,000 coverage.
[22:26 - 22:28] Does that ring a bell?
[22:28 - 22:30] Right, kind of bring some of that stuff to the surface.
[22:30 - 22:33] We've listened to a lot of sales calls
[22:33 - 22:35] where once we go through the subjection sequence
[22:35 - 22:37] and put a couple of things to the surface
[22:37 - 22:40] that all of a sudden they remember that they did it.
[22:40 - 22:41] Right?
[22:41 - 22:43] Not just clicking on things for final expense,
[22:43 - 22:46] they're probably clicking on things for Medicare.
[22:46 - 22:48] Remember, AEP just started,
[22:48 - 22:49] so they're gonna get bombarded
[22:49 - 22:54] with all sorts of stuff in regards to the health space.
[22:56 - 22:59] And lastly, we have here, I can't afford it,
[22:59 - 23:01] which probably is gonna be less common,
[23:01 - 23:05] but does happen, and the objection
[23:05 - 23:07] response that I've written here is,
[23:07 - 23:09] well, if you don't mind me asking,
[23:09 - 23:13] Were you wanting to cover anything beyond final expenses?
[23:13 - 23:14] No?
[23:14 - 23:17] Well, if it helps, finding affordable funeral and cremation plans
[23:17 - 23:20] under $50 a month is what I specialize in.
[23:20 - 23:22] Would you like to see if I can help you find something
[23:22 - 23:25] affordable as well?
[23:25 - 23:29] Now, if somebody can't afford something
[23:29 - 23:33] around that price point, if they can only afford $10, $15,
[23:33 - 23:38] $20 a month, is that a customer worth fighting for?
[23:38 - 23:41] I mean, really only you can answer that question,
[23:41 - 23:46] but for my experience, the people that are fighting tooth and nail to make a $20 a month
[23:46 - 23:52] payment are probably the ones that are going to be the first to cancel their policy when
[23:52 - 23:57] they don't have that $20 left at the end of the month.
[23:57 - 23:58] All right.
[23:58 - 24:03] Now, these are just a few objections that I have written here on this screen.
[24:03 - 24:08] What other objections do you battle with on a daily basis that you'd like us to cover
[24:08 - 24:11] in the future, maybe on a separate video?
[24:11 - 24:20] In any case, this is day one opener in our 10-part series of objection handling.
[24:20 - 24:26] I really hope you enjoyed part one of our newest 10-part sale series on mastering the
[24:26 - 24:27] sales process.
[24:27 - 24:30] This is for simplified issue life.
[24:30 - 24:34] If you have any questions or if you want to get in contact with me, again, all of my contact
[24:34 - 24:37] information is in the description below this video.
[24:37 - 24:43] Thank you so much for being here and take this information, go hit the phones and report
[24:43 - 24:45] back with your results.
[24:45 - 24:50] As always, my job is to help you have stronger, more sophisticated sales conversations, and
[24:50 - 24:53] I hope this is the start of helping you do that.
[24:53 - 24:54] Ciao.

=== FULL TRANSCRIPT (CONTINUOUS TEXT) ===

Happy Monday, everyone. Welcome back to Final Expense Teller Sales. My name is Dana Neeson.  It has been two years since I posted my original seven-part sales series on breaking down the sales process.  At that time, I was running a different agency with a different team representing one carrier,  and things have changed. I am now on the broker side running my own agency,  Empower Life Group, and representing multiple carriers.  And so I thought, what better way than to reintroduce this series than now?  But not only am I going to be revamping the original seven part sales series, I'm adding  three additional sections.  So this new revised improved sales series is a 10-part sales series.  We're going to cover the opener this time.  We're going to, of course, continue with discovery.  We're going to do credibility and education as one section.  We're going to find the need.  We're going to do underwriting this time.  We're going to talk about quoting and how you should quote people.  we're going to, of course, cover objection handling.  We're going to talk about writing the application  and best practices to do that.  We're also gonna be talking about the cooldown,  which is probably the most underlook  to underutilize part of the sales process.  And then we are going to end this series with follow up.  Now, if you stick with all 10 of these,  you will be so incredibly equipped  to handle your clients from hello,  to congratulations and beyond.  What I've found from two years ago,  if you go back and look at the series,  is we have a huge audience in the first video,  second video, and then it slowly drops off.  I'm doing a training right now  with Danielle Delgado for mindset and human behavior.  And she said something that rings so true  to what I typically see in this space.  Human beings are absolutely great starters,  but we are terrible finishers.  So don't be in that statistic.  Don't be a great starter and start a series,  and then taper off in the end,  and think you don't need every single part.  I want to challenge you as you go through this new series  with me to be just as engaged in video one and video two,  as you are in video 6, as you are in video 10.  Stick with it.  Post a comment every single time to not just hold yourself  accountable, but let this community know that you're here  and let me know that you're engaged.  As always, give this video a like if you find value to it.  And if you want to learn more about how to join my team  at Empower Life Group, we are bringing on agents  every single week.  We are looking for both agents license and unlicensed looking for an opportunity as well  as leaders who are looking to better support their current teams.  Now all of my contact information is in the description below.  You can visit my website at EmpowerLifeGroup.com and today we are covering the opener.  Alright, what you're looking at behind me is page one of the Empower Life Tele-Sales  script for selling simplified issue life specifically final expense.  one of this series is the opener.  So we're going to cover five different objections  that you typically get in the front end of the sale.  We have the introduction and then we have bridge  into the first question of discovery  and that's what we're going to talk about today.  The opener here, this is just one opener, right?  You don't have to use this opener.  You also don't have to use word for word for badam.  The objection responses that we're going to talk  about today, you should look at this as a guide and a skeleton and a road map to give you  some confidence to start tackling these phone calls as you get them.  I also want to touch on really quick something that we don't talk about enough, which is mindset  and fear and feeling like you're not good enough and scared of the clients and worrying that  you're not going to get a sale and investing in all of these leads and what if I don't get  an ROI?  know that all this stuff is happening behind the scenes as you are just trying to memorize  a script. But I want to encourage you and remind you about one thing. The people that are receiving  your call on the other end of the line are way more intimidated and afraid of you and  of all the other people that are calling them. Right? What are they afraid of? Picture your  avatar, picture your ideal client, and think about who you are calling, okay?  You are calling people that are retired, that are living on a fixed income, that are afraid  of getting taken advantage of.  They're afraid of making the wrong choice, right?  They're afraid of buying from the wrong person.  They're afraid of getting scammed.  They have all of their own fears going into the call.  And if you bring your fears into the call of not getting the sale, of not knowing what  to say, of stumbling over your words, those two fears are going to collide and you're  not going to serve anybody.  So you always remind yourself how lucky these people are to be on the phone with you, that  you have an opportunity to help them understand something and clear the air behind something  they feel completely overwhelmed and confused about.  So don't let that phone be a 10,000 pound weight.  Stop thinking about, you have to get a sale, you have to make money and start thinking  about what can I say so that I have the opportunity to help someone.  And once you can get through that clutter and get out of your own way and realize that  we're just here to try to have a conversation and help one human to the next, that it starts  to become a lot easier.  Okay, so we're going to start with our opener here right at the top.  They're going to answer the phone and you're going to assume the person who answered the phone is a person that inquired on the form and you're just going to say hi.  Betty, right, hi, Betty.  Hey, this is just Dana calling and I was calling about your request for information on the state regulated final expense plans here in California.  I'm just here to help you understand your options and answer any questions you might  have.  That's it.  That's your opener.  And if they don't say anything for two to three seconds, you go right, you skip objections  and you go right into this first line.  And so before we get started, I do need to let you know that our call may be monitored or  recorded.  And of course, that's if you are calling on a recorded line, which we do.  So we want to say that to state compliant.  And I just want to confirm a couple of details so I can get this information out to you.  I show here that you're in the state of California and your zip code is this.  If you have zip code, you can show the amount of coverage they requested.  You can verify beneficiary.  You can say their email address.  Whatever you have on your lead form, just feed back a couple pieces of information.  You might even have a favorite food or a favorite hobby or a favorite color.  some of those things to remind them of their inquiry.  All correct, or did I get anything wrong, right?  The positive or the negative.  And then I bridge right into,  and was this inquiry just for yourself,  or was it for anyone else as well, okay?  That's your introduction, assuming you get no objections.  Which happens, right?  If you are getting brand new leads  that just came in in real time,  you shouldn't be getting a significant amount  objections like I didn't do that or I'm not interested but you will get  objections right let's be honest and you'll probably get a lot of them the  most common objection is this first one right here I don't have time I don't  have time and why do people not have time because they just filled out the  inquiry they should have nothing but time right even if they filled out the  inquiry last night let me remind you that your prospects are not sitting by the  phone waiting for their life insurance agent to call them to try to sell them on a policy.  I also want to remind you that once somebody clicks on an ad on Facebook,  they are now in the algorithm. That means that you're going to continue to be served ads  from your competition. From so many people, they won't even remember which ad they clicked on  to get to you. Okay, they're going to see things that are free. They're going to see things for  state-approved burial plans. Your ad might be perfectly legit. Even the ads that you're buying,  the leads you're buying from, if you're buying third-party leads. Their ads might be very  very well written and they might have all the right expectations. But if you hear someone that says,  you know, I thought it was free, don't freak out. Okay, that could just be someone else's ad.  And that's a different objection. Let's focus on, I don't have time. Because if you're getting  high-intent leads, the I don't have time objection will probably be your most common.  So remember that naturally, we all have a little bit of sales resistance, okay.  We are getting interrupted in our day.  We didn't likely have an appointment.  We've answered the phone out of slight curiosity, and now we've identified that it's a sales  person on something we did inquire about, but do we want to have a conversation with them?  I'd rather not, I'd rather go watch my TV show or go play bingo or call my grandkids  or do whatever the last thing I want to do is talk to you.  Okay, that's what's going through their mind in the 15 seconds that you gave them your  introduction.  So if you also sound like you don't care, if you also sound unsure of yourself, if you  If you don't come in with confidence and volume, by the way, according to VINJANG, who  is an expert on communication skills, most people speak in a range of 1 to 5.  And most of us, when we're on the phones, we speak in a level 2 to 3.  And if we come in with this uncertainty, hi, this is just Dana.  And I was calling about your inquiry about the final expense plans.  I'm here to ask you to understand your options  and we end everything on an upswing,  kind of like a question mark in the middle of our sentence,  nobody's gonna want to talk to you.  Okay, so not only do you have to practice the words,  but you also have to practice how they're delivered  to give people a reason to be curious enough  to maybe stay on the phone with you,  but you will get resistance.  So when that person says, I don't have time  and you see these words written above my head  that says, you know, I understand I caught you at a bad time.  Would you happen to just have one minute  to see if it even makes sense to call you back later?  You better get that out fast.  And it doesn't have to be these exact words, right?  That's another thing I want you to remember.  Say this to where it feels like you're the one that wrote it  and you're the one that said it, right?  Sometimes I might even say, oh, that's not a problem.  You know, would you happen to just have one minute  to see if it even makes sense for me to call you back  after work, right?  If they gave me that,  or they're on their way to a doctor appointment,  no problem, I totally get it.  Do you happen to just have one minute  to see if it makes sense to call you back  after your doctor appointment?  So I'm not necessarily using the later phrase  every single time because I'm listening,  I'm actively listening to the words they're telling me  and I'm responding accordingly.  Also notice what two words did I emphasize  in my response.  I emphasize one minute,  because that's what I want them to hear.  If you study communication,  you know that the words that we emphasize  control what our clients hear and pay attention to,  and we can kind of control how they respond  based on what we emphasize.  So I'm specifically emphasizing one minute.  I'm also making it seem like,  oh, it's no big deal that they don't have time.  I hear that all the time.  So I want to just buy another 30 seconds to a minute  to try to see if this is a false objection.  Because at least 50% of the time, it's a false objection.  And if you can buy yourself 30 seconds to a minute  and you can get somebody to lower their walls,  40 minutes later you will be finishing up an application.  So do not let those people go, fight for the conversation.  Like your life depends on it.  Like, if you let that person off the phone,  you will never be able to make another phone call again.  If that's the mind trick, you have to play with yourself.  How many times, if you answered a sales call  or a telemarketing call,  and you said I don't have time right now,  and the other person on the phone doesn't even fight?  They just say, okay, bye.  Right?  That is how we are trained.  We're trained to say no,  and for the other person on the other end of the line,  to say, okay.  But when that person says actually,  Do you just have one minute to see if it even makes sense  to call you back later?  What you will find is most people will say, okay,  most people will say, okay, you got one minute.  Perfect, that's all I need.  Hey, can I ask was this inquiry just for you  or for someone else as well?  Maybe verify some information  and then we head into discovery,  which we will talk about on the next call.  Because there's many different ways to modify discovery  depending upon how you entered the call.  Okay, so I want you to think about right now,  we're only talking about getting the chance  to enter the call.  And the I don't have time objection  is should be your most common one  if you're getting brand new high intent leads.  Okay, let's move on to, I already took care of that.  Okay, I already took care of that,  which can be ambiguous.  I already took care of that,  could mean a lot of different things,  but we're going to assume that I already took care  it means they already purchased, okay?  I mean, I'm making an assumption, that's my choice.  And again, I act like it's no big deal, right?  I don't let that affect me, right?  Oh, that's not a problem.  Hey, how long ago did you get that?  If you watched my last seven part sales series,  you'll know this probably sounds similar  because why change something that works.  We stay consistent all the time.  We're not changing things up all the time.  we're staying consistent and we don't deviate. That's how we can start to create control  in our environment. Okay, hey, that's not a problem. How long ago did you get that? Oh,  a week ago, oh a couple days ago, oh a month ago, whatever it is. Well, hey, you know, while  I have you on the phone, would it be reasonable to offer you one more quote just to be sure  you were offered the best policy available? Okay, now you have two different ways people  can go. They can say sure and then of course we modify discovery which we'll  talk about tomorrow or on the next video. I don't know if that's coming out  tomorrow or they'll say no I'm good right so there's two different paths and of  course we want them to say sure you can give me another quote if they say no well  I try to double down which is not on the script but I do tend to double down  and I'll say something like, well, it would be important for us to at least make sure you're not into your waiting period  when you shouldn't be, or it lets at least take a moment to review your policy  to make sure that you have the amount of coverage you need or that you're not overpaying  because we see people overpaying all the time. It'll only take a couple of minutes.  Right, just to get the opportunity to have the conversation.  And I want you guys to remember that this is the point.  Getting pass the opener does not guarantee that I'm going to even get through  discovery. It certainly doesn't guarantee that I'm going to get to quote someone  or get a sale. What this is doing is it's sharpening my sword, it's sharpening  your sword so that you are in practice of rebutting and overcoming concerns and  resistance so that when you do have the person that's giving you a false  objection. You're Johnny on the spot. It just comes so natural to you that all the  sudden you're in discovery, you're in education, you're in the application  and you didn't even have to think about overcoming the objection because it's  just what you do. Now notice how I said it right. We have something called  interjection. I'm anticipating the objection when somebody's giving it to me. I  I do not let them finish, and I do not create space.  So when somebody says to me, I already took care of it, but thank you, though.  I do not let them say thank you.  I start talking louder over them where I said, most people speak at a two, three.  I'm speaking at a level four, five.  I'm commanding attention.  I'm commanding the virtual space.  And I'm having them stop to listen to me because I'm the expert and I'm the one that's  here to help.  Oh, I'm not interested. Oh, that's not a problem. How long ago did you get it?  Well, you know, hey while I have you on the phone, you think it would be reasonable to just offer you one more quote  just to be sure you were offered the best policy available.  And these hand motions that I'm doing all over the place, it's not just for YouTube,  it's not just for social media. I am actually doing this when I am on the phone with someone as if they were right in front of me.  Because when I'm animated with my hands, when I'm animated with my face, when I'm sitting  up with good posture, and I'm not slouched back, and I'm not just going through the motions,  and looking for low hanging fruit, I will have more opportunity to connect with someone  than you will.  So we act like the person that is an expert at overcoming objections, right?  We take up that space and we practice our craft and we deliver it in a way of the person  that already does it.  That's teaching it.  So you're going to take your calls as if you were me, as if you had all the confidence  in the world, as if you had already met, as if you had written these yourself.  That is how you are going to behave when you take these calls.  Alright, let's go to the next one.  I'm not interested.  Again, there's multiple ways you can handle these.  There's multiple ways to overcome objections.  These are just one way.  We talk about lots of other ways on our daily training calls inside of Empower Life Group.  Even my team doesn't follow these verbatim.  We talk about lots of different variations.  We have lots of leaders within the team that offer different suggestions or different ways  to handle things.  And that's some of the benefits that you get when you work and collaborate inside of  a team.  You're not just handcuffed to a script that has one option, but you get to hear multiple  options.  So this one option is, oh, again, oh, you know, that's not a problem or you're not interested  because you found it was unaffordable or that you might not qualify.  Okay.  Very simple.  They say it's not a, you know, it wasn't affordable.  I'm so sorry to hear that.  Like, you know, I specialize working with families on a fixed income.  We can typically find good final expense plans under $50 a month.  Is that something that feels unaffordable to you?  You know, I don't think I can qualify.  Well, you know, if it helps, we specialize working with families to get people  qualified with a variety of health conditions.  Can I ask what has you feeling concerned that you may not qualify?  Right?  Easy way to handle it.  Next one.  I don't remember filling this out.  Now you're gonna get this because maybe it took you  10, 15 attempts to actually get a hold of your lead.  Maybe they did forget, right?  Maybe the person just inquired  and did not want a phone call,  and so they're using that as a reason  to get you off of the phone.  Not everybody's going to be honest and forthright  with the fact that they clicked on something  they wish they didn't.  So keep that in mind as you're calling your leads.  Now if you're calling aged leads,  well you probably will get a lot of people  let's say they don't remember.  And maybe what you say has to circumvent that.  Maybe you lead with the fact that maybe they don't remember.  You know, I wouldn't expect you to remember  because we got this inquiry some time ago.  You know, maybe circumvent that ejection.  I am not recommending that people on this team  work age lead so we don't lead with our response  about you may not remember.  Someone says, I don't remember, I didn't do that.  Right, you know, that's not uncommon.  It looks like you may have clicked something on Facebook  about protecting your family  from out of pocket funeral expenses.  I might even say you listed your daughter  as your beneficiary and you were interested  in $10,000 coverage.  Does that ring a bell?  Right, kind of bring some of that stuff to the surface.  We've listened to a lot of sales calls  where once we go through the subjection sequence  and put a couple of things to the surface  that all of a sudden they remember that they did it.  Right?  Not just clicking on things for final expense,  they're probably clicking on things for Medicare.  Remember, AEP just started,  so they're gonna get bombarded  with all sorts of stuff in regards to the health space.  And lastly, we have here, I can't afford it,  which probably is gonna be less common,  but does happen, and the objection  response that I've written here is,  well, if you don't mind me asking,  Were you wanting to cover anything beyond final expenses?  No?  Well, if it helps, finding affordable funeral and cremation plans  under $50 a month is what I specialize in.  Would you like to see if I can help you find something  affordable as well?  Now, if somebody can't afford something  around that price point, if they can only afford $10, $15,  $20 a month, is that a customer worth fighting for?  I mean, really only you can answer that question,  but for my experience, the people that are fighting tooth and nail to make a $20 a month  payment are probably the ones that are going to be the first to cancel their policy when  they don't have that $20 left at the end of the month.  All right.  Now, these are just a few objections that I have written here on this screen.  What other objections do you battle with on a daily basis that you'd like us to cover  in the future, maybe on a separate video?  In any case, this is day one opener in our 10-part series of objection handling.  I really hope you enjoyed part one of our newest 10-part sale series on mastering the  sales process.
