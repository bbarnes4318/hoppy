 click raise your hand. Recorded, not all or sort. So I could record it. Give me one second. Testing. Oh, sounds great. Do you want to not date other trainings that may record it and can we access them somewhere? See, we do have recordings of the other trainings. Some of them were not recorded by us particularly. It was done by our appliance. So once we obtain it from them, we can share those with you. You probably refering to like the, because the only other training we did was for the dialer CRN platform. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're carrying an access to that thing. What's the stop in the link? Here. And then, yeah. Yeah, once we were, once we had seen that from the upline, we'll have a send out to you. We're actually in the bottom of something we're waiting for. I probably am going to be email. I'm going to be the slacker. How do you need that out there? It'll more than likely be an email or we'll just send it to, you know, whatever upline team, whatever, down much different. And there's some down here. And share it with you. I'm not thinking. All right, no problem. All right, so. All right, so I see some hands raised. Let's go with Grant. Oh, I don't have a quiz. I think that was from earlier we had been done. All right, let me go. I'm going to provide them here to read the first line of the script. We're going to go through this again. I'm going to do that for you. I don't want to do that. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Let's do it. Okay. Hello. This is Grant with an sure ATA. I'm the registered agent with a marketplace. We are on a recorded line. My job is to help you understand your health options and see if you qualify for government subsidies, which help save for your health insurance. Thank you. Grant. We always want to mention we are on a recorded line on every single call. That is a that is a law for telemarketing guys. So always want to let the clients know that we are on a recorded line. Please never skip that. All right. So let's go through lines BCD ENF and G. Need a volunteer for that. Let's just go through those lines. Are you looking for it? Individual one of family plans today. In case we can't just connect it. What is the best number to reach you? Do you have Medicaid, Medicare, VA, Tri-Cancer, Any other health measures outside of the marketplace? All right. This is Paul's right there. Thank you, Frank. So Medicaid, VA, Tri-Cancer, any other coverage outside of the marketplace. If a customer has any of these, what do we do guys? I know we have seen better in the near. Thank you for calling me. I have a pretty much dozen. We cannot enroll anyone who has Medicaid, Medicare, VA, Tri-Care, and now, for any other health insurance outside of the marketplace, if you are on the phone with a customer that has employer coverage through their group, we can enroll them. Okay. Because it's open enrollment. We can enroll them if they have employer group coverage in there and looking. Now, it would just be important to ask, just in case, technically, I mean, we should be a free for all, but just in case, make sure that they are in there and employers open enrollment period. Because employer group plans has different open enrollment periods as well. Makes them would be probably already know that. But we can enroll them. But if they have Medicaid, Medicare, VA, Tri-Care, and they are currently active, nothing we can. Maybe they received a letter in the mail that they said, oh, you know, your Medicaid is about to expire. If they get anything like that, and they still have Medicaid, but if they were, if the letter in the mail saying, it's about to expire, we can enroll them 100%. Okay. But if they did not receive that, and they are just on the phone, don't waste your time. Do not waste your time. I'll proceed with that for your hand raise. You will see what that was from earlier. Any questions? See if you hand raise. This one I made sure before we go. I'm not quite sure. Two. Quick, quiet. Yeah. So, what's in the scene? How long do you come to the door through libraries? Let's do their employer. That makes them intelligible for the tax subsidy. Do we need to go ahead and make sure they are there or where is that they're going to be paying not as soon as possible? That would probably be predicated on their income. Well, yeah. But you know when they have the tax fund, they're going to be paying for it. When they're entitled to other people, they're employers. That means they're no longer eligible for the tax subsidy. From what it is, being on the affordable. So, are we going to be doing something on that and make sure that they're actually going to get that tax subsidy that will be spending a good household for us? So, we just have a question. There's going to be that question that actually are they eligible for employer coverage. And when you say yes, that's the non-profit insurance for the tax subsidy. Well, as you know, there's certain answers that we do that's in the best interest of the customers, but just want to see if anything changes there. No, no, for sure, but you know, the rebate between the lines, right? We got it. We got it. At the end of the day, we got to do it in the best interest of the customer, you know? Let's see. I think Frank was reading. You could go ahead and continue on a lot on E. Frank, we're moving to an enterprise we're speaking with. Yes, to me, to John Smith, you want to confirm that JLHS and SMI G8? What do you think of it? What is your zip code? Do I have your consent to check the market police to verify your information and not boxes? You really, yes. Your health information is only determining your normal health disability and multi-share with a circumstance. All right, thanks Frank. I'll just write there. So guys, when we asked for consent, we must get a yes from the customer for consent. So if they say, yeah, or sure, or yeah, just politely say, is that a yes? And then they'll say, yes. You know, we just want to make sure we get a clear yes. Again, this is just for compliance. We have to cover ourselves at all costs. We don't want to take any chances. You know, it can be consented. A big, big deal with CMS as we all know, especially for my veterans there. All right, so let's see. Perfect. All right, let's continue. Make it another volunteer. Do you follow the active manager's signal? And one of the very years, if it's in red, we don't read that. That's just your message. That's what you do, right? That's good. So don't read as many of the comments every year. And he just means educate them all right? Yeah, exactly. And I'm glad you said that. When we go through our script with the customers, everything is about education. And everything is about just, you know, educating them on the process and, and, you know, and how it works. So if you get a customer on the phone and, you know, and let's say they are married, but filing separate, you know, it's important to educate them. Go ahead and read that. And in order to qualify for the subsidy, if Mary, you must file that to the joint rate. Keep in mind, if you do that by the joint rate, you may be subject to tax policy on the 20th rate of taxes. We recommend that you speak with that special. So how would you like to receive and single or as married? All right, so that number needs to be, I think, 2026 taxes because we're going into. Yeah. So the years on these will have to be changed guys just for 2026 that will be updated just one of the insure. We just know take that. So so yeah, guys, this has been education piece. And it's really just making sure that we say that on a recorded line and then proceed. And if you're giving them the option, so how would you like to proceed as single or married? Because a lot of complaints that we got guys as you know, are customers complaining that, you know, when they file their taxes, they got hit with these tax pet do.

--- SEGMENT 2 (approx 10-20 minutes) ---
 these penalties that you know it is if I'm on their tax return due to them obtained the the subsidy and how they filed so it's just important that we let them know hey keep in mind you know if you do not file jointly you may be so this is tax penalty on your twenty twenty six taxes we we recommend that you speak with the tax professionals so how do you like to proceed single-a-married and you just move in the move along that let's let's go ahead and go to go to the next one did you file your taxes for twenty twenty twenty twenty five and twenty twenty six no that's right I think it's twenty twenty twenty five actually yeah we should be doing twenty five because the tax the tax year would be filing for a new four and eight both twenty twenty six is from twenty twenty five so I think that twenty five from the previous question is correct right I think I have until eight both of you there twenty twenty five taxes yeah well we can't afford twenty five correct yes let's yes but twenty four twenty five should be the correct years so let's read that let's read that but should it be brought you should be twenty twenty four because twenty twenty five is not doing bill eight roll fifty whatever it is but are we are we growing them for plans that are effective twenty twenty six we are but nobody's going to have a tax file they're only checking pre-use your taxes so the only thing that would call five for previous year would be twenty four and only the other so income for twenty twenty five is definitely not it's just twenty twenty twenty four correct so we could make that if we can all right so let me call on Jordan bumpers can you go ahead and read the section for us please the next question space you are on mute can you come in a yes sir or I think I was double needed no problem so following your taxes as a part of the requirement to qualify for the subsidy you may still qualify but you have to resolve your tax following for at least one or both years twenty twenty three and twenty twenty four twenty twenty four twenty four okay can you get this resolved before the end of the year yes I will proceed with your enrollment but if you do not follow your taxes for the twenty twenty four twenty twenty five years you will lose your subsidy and your policy will be canceled please make sure you follow your taxes for twenty twenty five as well are you claiming any dependence for the coming year if you're in the last pause right there so so there's a high there's a high light here in red that says the customer has no previous apps in the marketplace at all proceed to enroll as a normal regardless of their filing status and the reason behind that is because so we want that the marketplace just wants to make sure that there are people that who's enrolled in prior year that are not filing and not you know showing proof of their income for eligibility so if someone's brand you may never file then obviously their brand used to marketplace they don't need to show evidence because they can never receive the subsidy before so this this rule when it comes to tax filings for prior years really only applies to customers who have already been eligible or used the subsidy that makes sense so if you get a brand new customer who's never signed up just received when the role is normal regardless of their tax filings because their brand new makes sense yeah you have a new one you have a new one you have a new one you have a new one you have exactly they've never utilized the subsidy they never obtained the government benefit so they're fresh the fresh they're they're you you just enrolled in his normal but you'll be able to identify that in surpa and you'll see if there were prior applications that were submitted you know through the marketplace as you guys know okay any questions about the tax so before before you guys asked any questions the biggest part of this process guys is really so that on a recorded line it's showing that you at least educated the customer on the on the the chances of the penalties that they can receive if if they don't file their taxes or what have you so it's so basically you're covering your license guys the all of this is about educating and covering your license and showing that you've gone through the necessary for the budget explaining you know what the customer has to do what taxes they need to file in order for them to qualify for subsidy and in order for them not to receive any tax penalties or what have you because we've seen it before for those of you have that that have better and here we've seen it where customers come back to file my taxes and you know I got hit with an $800 penalty and then next thing you know they follow complaint trying to lie and say that they never enrolled in the marketplace just so that they can get their $100 you know so we got to do our job guys let's not skip anything make sure we educate and roll as long as you educate and they understand and they understand you move you can you can just go ahead and move a lot there's a lot to be said about that line on the previous graph that says we recommend to speak with the tax professional because I used to have a boss is to say hey guys we're we're sure as professionals we're not tax professionals exactly you know and so what he would do is they say you know you might want to say something like that but don't get too deeply like you can tell us not to get too deeply involved but not over your knees well so you're asking for trouble 100% because what you're doing is you're you're giving them legally you're you're verbally letting the customer know that you are not giving tax advice and that you are not a tax professional just by saying that one line that covers all of that on the recorded line okay so that's that's a bit off that's good inside an observation let's go ahead and if there are are there any other questions on this part all right so let's continue to ahead and scroll all right so this section is income qualification this is probably one of the most important sections of this script and we're going to dive into it income qualification let's say cannot cannot get another volunteer just to read this section fourth please this question or does not give qualified income in your state the household income minimum requirement to 16,000 per individual $22,000 for a couple per year to qualify based on what you told me your current income is loaded in that is there any additional income or other sources of income that you expect this year that we haven't included such as tips bonuses over time pays raise side hustle or any other work related income we want to make sure your estimate is accurate as possible for approval all right so for for this one you you kind of skip ahead which is which is fine because this is this is the response that we need to that we need to give customers who do not give us a qualified income amount but let's start let's start at the top where it says income qualification is best you can guess I'm sorry as best you can guess what is your total household income $22,000 for 25 are positive there so the answer that the customer gives you will determine how you proceed on this call so there are two threshold numbers that I want to talk to you about one is 16,000 and it depends on the state so we have to make sure that we know which states there are states specific sections for that I actually included a link on this script if you see where that's clear here states specific qualification

--- SEGMENT 3 (approx 20-30 minutes) ---
 It takes you directly to healthcare.gov where you can identify what the minimum income is for that state for the state that you're in. Some of you veterans already know it by heart. But for those that don't, you'll see that link and then you can input the state and then it will know that you, you know, it'll give you an idea of what that minimum income requirement is. My language, my language and my script is a sign of justice. It's not a live link, so whoever is going to e-know it's true. It would be actually a live link in this script. Well, it should be a live link as long as they didn't send it to you in a PDF format. Because this, this is a live page. I would prefer that they share this with you. You know, as my question, live.in. You know, it's not a live link, so again, whoever is e-knowing on here, I find you know, in there for the script. So after we get through the script and any kind of excuse me, make another judge there, whoever is you going to get will be the right right one for live links and the end of the text. Yeah, I would prefer, I would prefer that the access that you guys have is live access because we could be making changes on the flight. And the last thing you want to do is, you know, print this first out or, you know, that's the reprimand. So how do we get the, how do we get an access to it? What work, I work on that for you. I'll ensure that all the downlines and all the all the, I think you just have access. Just to netify eye on that. If you write click on here and scroll down, it'll go open hyperlink in those sends you to the page. Right. But it doesn't go to an FPL chart. I'm not sure. Did you want to know? Right. Right. Right. That's not what you just write. Well, whatever. It works for me. It just doesn't go where I thought it would go. It goes just from thing a bit different. So that means it's a little bit different. Yes. No problem. So this is a little bit different. Scroll down a little bit. So if you click on the state, like let's select, I don't know, Florida. Yeah. And then select, yeah, you can select one person doing individual. And then put it in come. Let's put it in C where it says select your income range below 15,000, 650. Go to next steps where it says click the green button after that. If your income is below 15,000, 650, you're probably not eligible for Medicaid based on your income alone. You may qualify for Medicaid based on your income status. So it's basically just letting you know right there that anything below 15,000, 650 will be Medicaid. So you want to make sure that the income amount that you obtain from your customer when you ask, what is your expected household income? So this year, I would say the state of number would be 16,000. No, 16,000 is a state number. So for our household size of two, and then if you especially for two, obviously you guys know that income has to be higher. Go ahead and select the income. Click the drop down there. Yep, no, put it at two. And then if the drop down. So as you can see, at two, the minimum is 21,150. You see, so at one, the minimum is 15,000 is a country. That's like the bottom bottom line, number of where their household income needs to be based on the household size in order to qualify for a subsidy. And if they don't, if they make less than this amount, then that means that they will be referred to Medicaid. But we don't refer people to Medicaid, guys. We educate them and we enroll them. So let's go back to the script. Because we are not in the business, as you guys know, especially my veterans who's been doing this for a long time. We are not in the business of telling people you qualify for Medicaid, they'd have a good day. We do not do that. We probe, we educate, and we enroll, carry it. We're in the business of enrolling customers. So let's say you go to the script. Best you can guess what is your total household income for 2025? As for my says, I don't know. I think maybe 14,000. Okay. Customer 12, 2014,000. I am going to hold on one second. What I have to make some adjustments here. No problem. All right. Now, the customer tells me 14,000. That means that the customer did not give a qualified income amount. That means that they gave me a number below based on the household size. Okay. I know one of you mentioned the chart. You're 100% right. There is a chart. It's called the SPL chart, better or poverty level chart, where it kind of gives you a quick guide of, you know, you just select the household size and then you go across and you'll let you know what that minimum household income amount is. I'll go ahead and look into a providing a chart for everyone as well. If that's something that you're more accustomed to using. But the reason I'd like to use this link is because it gives you the most updated number because you're going to write on healthcare.gov to sometimes charts could be dated. So that's pretty much the only reason why I have this link to answer questions. So all right. So customer said 14,000. I need a volunteer to read this section. You have the customer with their household income is and they told you 14,000. For still less year hand raised and you volunteer. All right Jeremiah. You want to do the honor of reading this section for us please? And reading the second paragraph? So you're going to see the first blue paragraph. So what happened is you asked the customer what is the total household income? And for 2025 and they told you 14,000. Now you know 14,000 will not qualify them for subsidy. So what are you going to do? You're going to read the first paragraph. You're going to educate your clients. So let's go ahead and read that. Okay. So in your state the household income minimum requirement is 16,000. 15,000 per year to qualify based on which you told me your current income is lower than that. And is there any additional income or other sources of income use? I hope to see that we have an included. That's just as long as this overtime may already be side jobs or any other work related income. You just want to make sure that your instrument is acceptable for a de-approved. All right. Perfect. So as you can see guys we're giving customers every single which way on how they can increase their income. So the unapproved amount that they just gave you. So you're basically saying hey tips, side jobs, are you selling something on the street? Over time, or raise anything. Any other work related income? Do you think you could make a little bit more than that this year? Oh yeah yeah I do. I could probably make it around you know yeah I could be around 17,000 if I had all that okay perfect. You just need to get the number from the customer and just continue. Yes. I just want to make that very clear. Okay so when you when you do it this way, the reason there was another way that we were kind of doing it back in the day from my veterans, we want to kind of steer away from going too hard like that. If you know what I'm saying we don't want to course, coarsing. I know that was one of the violations that CMS had that was causing issues for for agents licenses and you know if you do it this way and you educate them, they're going to pick up what you're putting down. You know what I mean they're going to understand what you're trying to tell them. It's like listen I'm trying to get you approved here. Tips, bonuses over time, or raise side jobs, anything is impossible for you to at least meet the requirement that is the household income minimum requirement that is in your state which is 16,000 right for an individual. So there's two people in the household, 22,000 for an individual plus one right depending on how many people are going to be, how many covered members on the application. Right so so this is a very important part of the script. Don't just let them off. Oh you make 14,000 are you having a nice day? No. Hey in your state.

--- SEGMENT 4 (approx 30-40 minutes) ---
 Yadiyada yada tips bonuses raises you are you working anything be creative you know You could say this is a guy guys I you know, I want you to I wanted to come off in Nashville Say it in your own ways or if you're if you're anything else that you may be doing from home Do you beat cookies or do you like I don't know anything anything that could That could get you qualified because your minimum is 16,000 qualified minimum of qualified for a substitute, you know Any questions about this park guys before we continue to approach you without what I always like to tell people to Is I always given the option of saying look Can you plan on making extra money even if you're not doing it right now? Is there anything that you plan in the future coming up this year that maybe it makes a mixture money and then if they yes You put your business penalty for Or not making less is only a penalty if you make more That is correct So you might as well I'll just add that line there. Do you plan on making more money because again guys the at the end of the day As you guys know the the end song is Based on future income. It's not based on what they made last year. It's based on what they're expecting to make an extra That's what they're getting qualified for so Hey, I know you have I know you're saying 14,000 but do you plan on making more money? tips over time Is it possible that you could potentially reach that minimum requirement of 16,000 or 22,000 whatever the number is right Based on that coin based on a client household sauce. So that's really good. That's really good line up Paul All right guys. Let's let's continue if there are any other questions if customer income does not qualify for subsidy I hope I hope you guys don't Read this line on a lot of your calls because this is if they absolutely don't qualify You probably on the phone someone and they're they're not even budgets and we're in here that amount but typically Caron road over time bonus Christmas yeah all that yeah, be creative Do what you got to do to get them approved guys Make sure you make sure they're educated and they agree So this so this second part I'm gonna read it because I don't want you guys reading this on on your calls It looks like you do not qualify based on the information you provide it You can contact your state Medicaid They may be able to assist if you apply for Medicaid and get a denial letter We may be able to assist you in the meantime. Let's see if there are any other products you may be eligible for And then at that point you could always upsell them You know for for an answer to the product, but of course if you do a really good job on the first paragraph And you will not be reading that line so do a really good job on the first paragraph guys As even people who are really really low in thumb They will pick up what you're putting down And I think I'm going to put you All right awesome all right, let's continue. Let's let's grow All right, let's stop here. So this section is establishing value I'm gonna call on let's see Karan let's go ahead and read this this section here establishing value Where are you looking for in a health insurance plan? Right awesome, so why are we asking that question? One of the things that I've realized guys and sales is that when you Know that There's times where we just want to get on to the next call closed But these questions show that you actually care about the customers needs and the more the customer sound Here's that you care the more likely they're gonna proceed with the enrollment with you So simple questions like this that you must ask if you're just gonna throw a plan and just Fourth feed it and shove it down there throw You know what I mean can you close deals like that? Yeah, are they gonna stick? Maybe you know what I mean, but you know little questions like they say what are you looking for in your health insurance plan? I wouldn't settle for like Nothing really I just want coverage. No, like are there any any medications that you must have covered Do you feel pain anywhere is there anything that you need your insurance for you? Are you just looking for if you're just regular doctor visits? You know stuff like that and then when you probe you'll get something out of them Okay, um, once you you don't have to stay on this part for a long time dies But it's just it's just a matter of establishing the value Proposition that you're creating for your customer, you know, um, and then at that point We just go ahead and begin plan search okay Thank you Thank you for the information One moment while I search for marketplace Harry, I see a hand raise. Harry go ahead When I understand from the way you want to Quick with this script He's don't really want us to go into to detail medications They have so much like you would with some Medicare plan which is crucial you play because they 65 plus is out of an accurate state We're not at that part yet. We do definitely go over detail of the policy with the customer because it is qualified. It is required by CMS Review the outline of benefits Okay, yeah In a couple of comments, Harry, I'll come on. I'm going to do a walk through of an actual enrollment so you can see what it's like and we'll ask the doctor and you know some of the scripts Absolutely All right, so Notification of subsidy let's go ahead and read that line there. Um, can I have a volunteer? Notification of subsidy Great news you've been approved for federal federal subsidy of let's approach which will Me apply directly to your policy premium today Perfect, thank you so Always start with great news at this point Um, you have the reason you're reading this line is because you've already pulled up the policy on on surpa You already know the plan you're selecting for the customer you've done your search You've you've established value. Hey, what are you looking for in your plan? You know what the customer's looking for And now we're searching the marketplace for that plan. You found it. Hey, I have great news you can qualify for subsidy of $500 which will be applied directly to your All-as-be-prane today, okay So the next section here that you've seen read guys that says then correct snippet This section typically what I like to do is when I find a plan for my customer I typically take a screenshot of that plan and I send it as a text message to the customer So that they can visually see what I'm verbally telling them You know it's a visual verbal connection, you know, so And then you'll just say hey, as you received the text of the policy on your phone. Let's review it together. You know So we'll we'll navigate those features as we You know as as we get our portals or the dollar. Let's let's go ahead and scroll All right, let's pause right here So You're gonna need a volunteer for this section right here. We're gonna go over the outline of benefits So it's part you were looking for That was I was mentioning earlier All right, I'm gonna call on someone random. So the random call I think it was a man. It was a word. All right, let's go. Yeah, so on the blueboard there is above it So I thought a great plan with an anthem blue cross blue shield And then has all of your preventive care such as Your annual checkup Colenoscopy your blood work and lab work so all your regular checkup things is fully covered 100% Now if I see See now if you need to see the doctor During the time During the year for anything else your primary doctor copay With look at bushfield is here it all is Just be a specialist with the copay Your post-lush ill is only $30 Right, thank you. Thank you. You are different. Yes, you see you see this section highlighted in yellow You must also mention these key components Let the customer know what the coin turns is. Let the customer know what the deductible is and the maximum amount of pocket it pocket earth CMS Guys we have to mention it on the Policy that we are offering it is crucial I actually have a agent that got hit with a With with an interaction from CMS based on not saying that and they told him hey you need to You need to mention the coinsference that deductible in your maximum amount of pocket when going over the online Benefit to decline

--- SEGMENT 5 (approx 40-50 minutes) ---
 At least you go ahead. Well, I just have a question, you said it's crucial to mention the CMS. What does that mean? I don't know. Per CMS is crucial for you to mention the other key components of the outline of benefits that you are offering your customer on whatever carrier or product you found for them, blue-cross and better whichever one. You have to mention Cohen's insurance as well, deductible, and that's out of pocket. What does CMS do? CMS stands for the Center of Medicaid Center for Medicaid Services. They are basically the police of ACA and Medicare. Okay. In the police. They're the casualty. Commissioner. Yeah, they're the police. We want to consider them like, I don't know, the best way to kind of describe it is like, I'm preparing you guys to drive, and I want you guys to drive at a really decent speed so that we can get to our destination and make as much money as possible. But they're state troopers that are always clocking and they are called CMS. Okay. That's a big question. And this year, honestly, I want to be surprised that there's probably going to be some undercover calls happening in the system somewhere. Yeah. Those are, uh, there's Hannah. Oh, yeah. They got, they got, they're doing unique things like that too. And again, guys, this is not to scare you. You know what I mean? This is just a reality of the business. You know, you're going to run into, um, they call them trappers. Secret trappers. Sometimes they're just there to see how you do, let, let's see how you present. You're script and, and there's a fake in notes. You know, and sometimes they'll, they'll even go through a hole in the wall with you. Most of the time. So, um, that's why it's so important for us to, you know, make sure that we, we don't put corners. You know what I mean? The more corners you cut, the more reliability you make it on yourself. You know, let's, so we don't need, we don't need to do that. We can still make a ton of money doing it the right way. Okay. The main thing is you just, you don't want to, you're not in a town, and you don't want to miss leave them, and you don't want to steer them into a certain plan for your financial benefit. So, you got to ultimately try to do what's best, you know, for a customer. But obviously we're doing it to make money, but you just got to do it. Or you're doing it correctly. Mm-hmm. Absolutely. Thanks Paul. So, uh, let's see. Critical illness plug. I do have a plan that can help some of these costs. We will discuss after we pick your plan. Okay. So that's just there. We, we're not going to go into, I'm going to schedule a training. We'll, we'll go into ancillary tomorrow, and we'll talk more about those. But I really want to just go through this, go through the process with you guys. But, um, for those of you that don't know what a critical illness is. Critical illness. It covers cancer, heart attack, and stroke. And in the event that your customer has either a cancer, heart attack, or stroke. And I think this product also has life insurance, or if they die by chance, doctor bid. And you those things happen, they get a lump sum payment paid to them. Or obviously life coverage goes to the beneficiary. Um, and that's just another add-on that we, that you can use for, for your clients. Especially for like high deductible plans. Um, just kind of mentioning this now, because of another answer. Yeah, it's a critical illness. It's like, so, so if you have like a high deductible type of plan, um, a lot of times, sometimes, not a lot of times. Sometimes a customer might, oh, that's a high deductible, but it may be the only zero option. Or it may be the most affordable option that's fisher budget. So it's like, listen, I know this is a high deductible. But I have something that will pair perfectly with this as critical illness. It's only, I don't know, 40 bucks, 50 bucks a month. Dr. Bitt, anything happened to you. Cancer heart attack or stroke. You'll get paid a full lump sum and that'll cover you in the event of a medical emergency. Because cancer heart attack and stroke are like the tea like, Hop. Those are like the top three things that, and cause and had a strophic medical bill, right? So that, that just gives them some, um, some assurance and, and it also protects things. When assuming you got a, uh, a, a slightly like customer like that, and there. You're presenting with the plans going to high deductible. It probably is, it's probably like a bronze point. High deductible zero premium and you can solve with the answer, like, over here, looking at you to take with this big bill, or something, you know, that happens. We got this answerary coverage to help, you know, pay for what, your insurance will in a cost of $40. So really good. Okay, exactly. Because, no, and again, that's really, sometimes you're going to have customers that will, that will really bark at a high deductible, but it may be the best option for them based on their budget, you know? Or they may, you know, so it's like, listen, this is really, here's something that I can do to pair that will go well with your policy. It's only X amount per month. God forbid you had a cancer heart attack or stroke, you know, it'll pay or an higher deductible. You get paid a hundred thousand, whatever the amount is, and you can use that to pay your entire deductible, and do whatever else you want with the rest of the money, which is paying for your bills, because you can't work because you had a cancer on a doctor stroke. You want to me? Yeah. So, all right. So we'll, we'll skip through that part. We'll go more, and we'll dive more into that tomorrow. Because we do have another training that will schedule some tomorrow, guys, but let's go ahead, and we'll skip over dental and vision. That's another upsell opportunity. All right. So close the sale. Where do you like to have your insurance card mail, too? I mean, this is pretty self-explanatory. This is actually personally my favorite part of this script. I don't know if this is your favorite part, but my favorite part is the clothes. That's when we make the money, right? Let's go ahead and let me get a volume here to read my favorite part of this script, close the sale. All right. I'm going to call on... I can keep reading, if you want, you can call some AS. You can call someone else. There's so many people on here. And I'll speak up, people on the one. Mark, Mark, Mark, I hope I pronounce your name, right? Unless it's Mary Kay. No, it is Mark Kay. So, good. It is Mark Kay. Yeah. Okay. I thought it was for short. Alright. Let's do a Mark Kay. Let's go ahead and read the best part of this script. Okay. So assuming that there's an amount, dude, it's not fully covered. What method of payment would you like to use? These are our master conferred. I love that. Good, discretion. She just got right into the money. That's what I'm talking about. Alright. So first question, where would you like to have your interest cards mail to? And of course, guys, this part is critical. If you did not sell a zero dollar premium, what method of payment would you like to use? These are our master cards. Or whatever method of payment that they have. Alright. Mark Kay, let's continue. Okay. Let me just confirm the spelling of your first and last name as it appears on your tax returns. Blah, blah. Again, I have your data birth as whatever that's correct, right? Mm-hmm. Which are email address and again, you are your status incorrect. Yes. And for sure. Alright. Awesome. Alright. So let's pause right there. So, so let's get security. I'm going to have had issues getting social security numbers from clients. Everybody. Everybody. Everybody. Yeah. The disposal is a critical part of the script. Right? You can't enroll without the social. Just want to give everyone a heads up. Mm-hmm. You cannot enroll the sale without a social. The social is basically like the name as you getting the credit card information. It's literally the same. If especially if this is zero premium, you're going to need that. So, in the event that your customer objects to giving the social, I don't feel comfortable. I've been scammed before. This is a critical part of this script. And I've heard, I hear people have a lot of different ways of how they go about it. And I've heard really good ways. I've heard ways that are effective. I've even heard ways where people respond to this, and I'm like, I don't even know how that works. But they still got the social. But the one thing that I've recognized and being in this business for so long, especially on this part, even that get the social are the ones that sound the most confident when they ask for it. That's what I've found. That's the number one underlying factor that I found that, where the agents who have the most sales, they just so confident. It's almost like they're expecting it. It's almost like they're not even asking for it. It's like, you guys are familiar with order taking, right? It's almost like they're just taking, they're just order taking, and they're, and it's part of the process, and it's not a request. It's like, of course I'm asking you for social, so how or so. And that's really how you should approach it because, that's, without the social, they can't qualify for a subsidy. How is the government going to even identify with it?

--- SEGMENT 6 (approx 50-60 minutes) ---
 they are impossible. How are they going to get paid for the subsidy? How are they going to recognize that they are in fact Jim Jones and Ohio without their social rights. So, this is not a common sense, but I don't know what it is. Sometimes I hear agents, they get really stuck on this part, man. You know, for some agents, they would, what is your social, you know, they self-conferent from the beginning of the script. And then once they get to the social, it's like an anxiety thing and the one thing that I've got, and I've framed hundreds of agents and I just tell them, I'm like, guys, the one thing that I notice is the more confident you sound and the more I don't really, you get that, it's kind of like that, I don't really care. I already know you're going to give it to me, it's a super confident, you know, they typically will just follow the process and just give it to you, you know. All right, because some might add to that as well. I mean, I think it will come along. It comes along. If you, if you, if you build a really good rapport in the beginning of the call with a taller than a plus two, it should be an agent and it goes to a period. One hundred percent, that is one hundred percent correct. Because... So why I change it to EM, I just say, and you're social. It seems less, it seems more normal than what is your social. It seems less. Yes. I just say, and you're social. I really like that because what's happening is you're expecting it, you know, it's not a, it's not a section of the script where all of a sudden your tone changes. And the reason I'm stopping on this part, guys is because I hear it a lot. I hear it. It happens, you know. But don't, especially for agents who have already had issues with getting this social, it's like a sticking. It's like one of those parts of the script where they kind of tense up. You know what I mean? And then they're like crossing their fingers and closing their eyes like, what is this social? You know? But be confident. Just ask for it. You know, it's normal, you know? You know, are you a citizen? All right, great. And, and your social please? I don't actually... How would you even think of this? Yeah, I think it's going to change anything in the script. And then the file and hand your social. Yeah. And then the file is like a big something. Oh, I have. I have never had a problem getting socials. You always tell them, the verify it. Don't act for us. It's a ver if you already have the only one you have it or not. They're not verified with social. Like you already have it. And what the peridine computer is basically encrypted. It's like, like, auto insurance or homeowner's insurance or we can encrypt it. Well, we keep this a last form. So just verify your social please. Right. So I'm glad you said that. And that works for a lot of agents too. You know, like I said, I've heard so many different ways. There's so many different ways, right? But the reason I'm kind of bugging down on this is because you could do an amazing job all the way from the top. And as soon as you get here, you know, I just want to make sure that everyone understands on the social part. Just be confident. Now, let's say you do everything right. Let's say you built good rapport. Conversation was great. Everything was on point. You get to the social and they still kind of gave you like an objection, right? All right. So let's go ahead and click on us to my objection for so actually on the most we may. I don't think we have access. Let me see. Okay, never mind. So I'll update that. Just go ahead and I'll go ahead and update that link because I'm going to make a comment real quick on that. Go ahead. It's number five probably for a reason because it's right after number four. So if you're getting objection for the social, you just refer back to number four. It's how we verify that you're in UFS. It's not really a complicated. Yes. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. You know, it's funny you mentioned it's funny you notice that because I actually, I actually created this script this way because it flows in a way where it's like, okay, you're a UFS and okay, prove it which is also, you know, you're a UFS and give yourself it. You know what I mean? And then it kind of flows with it. So you're 100% correct. It's like this is how we verify. Everything that you're telling me is valid. It's invalid just give it to me. I mean, we're just getting you an health insurance. And it's great because you know what's crazy guy. When you, when you, I'm, I'm sure you guys have perfect auto insurance before. Yeah. Isn't it pretty cool? Auto insurance. I've never, I've never objected to anyone from progressive or gyco or you know what I mean, state farm. I've never objected to giving my social to them. Not only because I know I'm with a reputable company but it's because the way they ask. It's like, of course you're going to give it to me. This is part of the process. Guys, this is health insurance. Of course they have to give it to us. That's the only way they can get approved, you know? So I'm just, you know, giving you guys some perspective. So, but, but, but, but, but they have also, my face is, I mean, I don't want to be. Just being a little bit more. The thing is also the thing with the Sanctuary, one of their flat, you have to, I mean, because the, you know, push back when that comes to that. A lot of people get offended, especially if they're from another time to work. I don't care. Yes, I might not. But somebody needs to meet you, please. Yeah, so sometimes they get a little bit of a fin. So, what, like I said, what usually works is, like, like, if they're doing Sanctuary, like, you know, you know, to make sure you say you are pretty much. Especially if you want to be like, who you are. You can't be like, but sometimes, you say, I want to be like, you have citizen. People with other countries, they do have socials, they get offended. They call me. In some cases, yeah, I could see. I could see that. If everybody's just not adding one thing on, or go ahead. So, I mean, as far as when it comes to asking for the socials, I mean, I don't think anyone should have a problem with it. It's just like I used to think, right? As long as you're confident, you're asking for the social, it shouldn't be a problem. No matter what, what you're trying to do in the US, they're going to ask you for a social. If you even try to go to Verizon, instead of a post-maid account, we've got to get a big an asset, a social. That's just how business works. Once you understand that, and you're approaching these customers the same way with that mindset, you should be completely confident, because we're the shit business. They're getting solutions. But that's how long we say. Yeah, 100% correct, man. But that's the mindset. Having that mindset is what gives you the confidence to obtain it. And that's why you always get socials, because I look at your calls. You get socials. It's not an advice. It's also not an advice for you, because you know it's just part of the process. So that's all it is, guys. It's a mindset. It's a bit of confidence. Get it. And keep the questions. Go for the close. All right. So you got the social. You got the social. Next step is, what's the next step, guys? After the social. And someone read that below. Wherever, here she. Hi, let's read it. Okay. Just a second. Next step is a very nice, verification process. This is not a verify that your government's not to do these stages twice for a moment. All right. Let's go ahead and review the verification. All right, guys. So for the verification, guys. You know, this again, the verification is really for your protection, guys. This is for your protection. The verification really has nothing to do with the customer. This is really for your protection. For the agency that you work for the protection. And so that way everything is buttoned up, knit, cut, locked in, verbal signature. No questions. They can file any complaint that they want. And we have this on recording. This protects you. It protects you like, kind of like, you know, it makes you better. So we want to read this on every call. Really not that long. But it does protect you. So let's go to the verification process. Let's see. Once the volume is here, just go to the verification. I'll read it. All right. Let's do it. Okay. Now, before we continue, as I stated in the beginning, this call is being recorded. My name is Tavar Smyr. I'm with EHG. Today's main here is going to be October 30th of 2025. Please state your full name and be to birth, for consent to enroll in the marketplace. Don Jones. Okay. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go to reads from disclosures. Please wait to respond from till acts to reach the terms. Now, you have selected the United Healthcare Silver Plan. Your monthly premium here after the subsidy is going to be zero dollars. And your estimated income here is at 21,000 in the effective date here for this plan is going to be January 1st. Now, do you hear by, you know, you have to be here by to provide your verbal consent and authorize and ensure ACA to enroll you in the United Healthcare Plan. Provided to provide it in the marketplace. Do you agree? Yes. Awesome. Awesome. Now, you authorize and ensure ACA to update your health plan and make necessary changes for one year to keep the policy active request required to document extensions and notify you via call, text or email. Do you agree? Yes. phenomenal. Now, you authorize us to auto-remove your policy for plan year.

--- SEGMENT 7 (approx 60-70 minutes) ---
 2006, to ensure no labs in coverage. Do you agree? Yes. Awesome. Now, do you understand where the United House care policy is separate from in any other products you may have this scud or maybe purchasing today? If you understand in Worcester Proceed, he's confirmed by saying it. Yes. Okay. Awesome. Now, this can sit stage active unless you email us at service at ehgfor.com to cancel anytime. Thank you. This can sit your electronic agreement and signature on your application. All right. Let's continue. So, I mean, well, before we continue, any questions about verification. It's pretty interesting. And we have a quick question. We work from ensure ACN to EA-CN. Well, we have to make some updates. Okay. I just want to make sure that what is the right thing for there? It's very clear. Okay. But in the email, yeah, that's all for the updated. The task that music has to pay attention. This is our question. I will question on before. Please. Sure. Go ahead. Yeah. Because you talk about the social article, the number to verify it to make sure they only use it. We can order to have social accounts and categories. Are they allowed to get marketplace? Yes. Okay. Thank you so much. Yes. Do you want? Right. Yes. So, as long as they have the social, and if they have a green card, they are eligible to enroll. Do they need to present it? Like so we can upload it to like that room or anything like that? That's a good question. Now, it all depends on if it pops up on the eligibility results, right? Right. So, I mean, for me, you know, if it pops up, I'm going to ask for it right then in there. Take a screenshot. Send it to you right now. I need a copy of your, what is the number? I, 97, like there's so many different, I guess there's a few different types. You know, whatever the cards are. I had this, I had this happen maybe like two, three years ago. That's why it asks. And I got to get me sure. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to show you something. He's green card to me. I decided to see him as I think it was. All right. Cool. All right. Okay. Right. But are we doing that? Because didn't some of you say yesterday, there's a department that's taken care of all the DMIs and such? That's why I asked. Right. That's why yesterday and what training are you referring to? Are you referring to the I don't know last night, maybe. Are you talking about the dialing training? Yeah. I think I'm like, what's your health share? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, share. Oh, I see. Well, well, let me put it this way, guys. In order for everyone to get paid documents or record, and if there's any documents that are required, we have to obtain them. It's important for us to do our best to do our deal is this and obtain those documents on that initial call. Okay. Now, for whatever reason, you've done your part and you are and they don't have it or they are enabled of tainted and it's important for you to educate them and say, hey, this is a requirement. If you don't have this, you're not into you, you won't be covered. You have to have to have this document and hold them to it. And then we can, of course, we'll create a process to ensure that there's an outreach, you know, for those customers, but again, it's your job, you're at the front lines. You got to get it. You got to get it right in and there. Makes sense because if we, if we close a bunch of sales, there's a whole bunch of documents being requested and they're not being obtained. Nobody gets paid. How are we going to get paid? Those policies won't go into effect. I know back in the day that used to give you what 90 days, you know, those days are over. We don't have 90 days to collect documents no more. Those days are long gone. I think we only have what 30 days now. Yeah. And their policies going goes into effect January 1st. It's a pleasure. Yeah, it's a pleasure. I went for sure. Yeah, the window was super short. It went from 90 days to 30 days. So, we got to make sure we get those. We get any docs that are being requested. We got to make sure we attain those initially. But since emergency, as I say, 100%. 100%. 100%. All right, let's get it. All right, that's so thank you. This constitutes your electronic agreement and signature on your application. So that's what you say after verification. Thank you so far for reading that for us. Verification is pretty straightforward, guys. I've rarely ever heard customers give pushback. Everything is about confidence. You read it. Get the yes. Keep it pushing. All right. When you reviewing the eligibility that letter, this verify there is no Medicaid, Medicare, or VA requested docs. Make sure the customer can provide the appropriate documentation including citizen ship's security and combat immigration status and proof of identity before moving forward. Yeah, definitely do your best to obtain all that information. Now, who can tell me if you see Medicaid, Medicare, or VA requested docs? What does that typically mean? If you see that on the eligibility letter, guys, for my veterans? They're not qualified. Why? Because probably their incomes already below the threshold. Okay, what else could they mean? I think they're different. Yep. Try to make a truck here. Exactly. They may act that we have that. They may have Medicaid or Medicare. It's going to happen. It's going to happen, guys. So be on the lookout. Be on the lookout. If you went through all this and you identified that something pops up saying that they have Medicare, the first thing I'm going to say is, hey, you need to provide me with a letter showing that you are losing your Medicare. I need a Medicare letter. Not that you're Medicare's end or something. Because they won't be able to proceed. You won't be able to all this. You can have no Terry. You know, no Terry has tried Terry usually. Right. Yeah, but what I'm saying is that that's included. That's Medicaid, Medicare, VA or CrackHair. If they have any of them, is that what I mean? I can't say, you can't be into federal programs at once. That's our rack. You can't be on two government funded programs at once. All these are government funded programs, guys. That's not accurate. I want VA and Medicare Advantage. They work together. There's Medicare Advantage and all the plans. Yeah, but it's still part of the aid and part of these challenges. Yeah, but that will be a disaster. Yeah, I think it's not the Medicare Advantage. You brought those examples to private one. Yeah, either way. You can't. You can't have that either on this morning. So yeah, you can't have it with ACA at the end of the day. Right. That's that's pretty much the main point, you know. All right, guys. Let's let's roll. Let's keep that's keep going. After your verification, if you see that there's no docs needed, or different documents were requested by the marketplace. That's a beautiful sign that means you don't need to provide any docs. If Dr. Required, your application is missing some requested documents from the government without this, your policy is at risk of losing your subsidy. The requested docs are and you just pretty much read off what they are and tell the customer I need you to send this to me like right now. We get documents on the same call. We're not this is no giving me a call back. Send me an email. No. Right then and there. Many of you try to call back a customer after ending the call. What percentage is that from my veterans? Less than zero. So the best time to get to get a document with a customer as well. You have them on the phone. Do not say go ahead. I would just wanted to suggest something because that is very, very true, especially with a lot of applicants. They do have a government assisting cell phone coverage and sometimes daily have a for 90 days or so. So when you try to get a hold of them, you will be able to with a using a family friend's phone for the application. So my suggestion to you and it to actually work very well. As for on the phone this year, whatever document is needed, I have them prepare it and take a photo and send it to you as you're on the phone with them because they want them move on and they have their own lives. That's a great idea. If you're photo and ID, if it's a document that's being requested, then you can do me a favor. Can you go to a piece of paper right now and a pen? It doesn't have to be perfect. It just is not as as eligible. Can you write this statement out or hate me? Can you do me a favor? I'm the part right now. Can you take a...

--- SEGMENT 8 (approx 70-80 minutes) ---
 photo and email it to me because of requesting this and it's not your manager coverage. And it works, it works, I would say 80% of the time it does work. So don't wait to send them a text message after really saying we're going to send you text message to follow them because not at a 10 times you're not going to be able to hold them. That's a good idea. That's a real life now. It can just screenshot and text or take a picture. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I think I'm ready. Anybody knows that I take a picture? Well, definitely nothing. Some people are not so text savvy. So, you know, it's happened before where the KV of a family member that can help you out. And something is somehow some way or what do this ERM also have them a text on my cable. By the way, I just texted you. This is my contact. Save it under my name. My name is Janesse. You can see there's health insurance agent and we can keep in contact with the documents and then don't come back on to what they're doing now. Thank you, Janesse. That's a very good recommendation for for that process. Very, very good. Thank you. All right. We are just going to quickly. It just will quickly. Well, up until we have to submit documents or something. Is that one out of five? Is that something that we don't normally as a priority holder? It's going to be a part of itself. You're going to get it. It's going to happen. You're going to get it going there. But it's definitely not going to be every single call. You understand what I'm saying. Yeah. But it's very rare. I would say for example, for the Medicaid or the Medicare or VA, it's one of social is linked to an application that they submitted already or their name is very similar to a previous application. So for example, if they apply for Medicaid, they got denied sometimes. And at all the time, healthcare.gov will ask for a verification that they're not receiving coverage because somehow they're a name, get a birth and their social is linked to already an application. That's an end of the development income as well. If they submit their adoption, if they've fathered taxes, sometimes going to ask for an income verification but it's not often. So for example, if you have 10 clients, maybe one of those are two are requesting documents. It's not often. Oh, cool. I think somebody, Mark Hayes, has her hand up. Yeah, thank you for noticing our preview. So just looking at the verification again, where it says about renewing for 2026. So are we mainly focusing on their December first, getting our names on that so that you all can renew it for 2026? Or are we doing whichever one they want? Or are we focusing on 2026? Where's our intent, our focus here? One certain, one certain. Your friends who line D, you authorized us to order renew your policy for planning at 2026 to ensure an old-assent coverage. Right. Yeah, so in the event that the customer, like assuming that there's no increase in premium, you know what I mean? If it remains at the same zero dollar level, that's just us getting consent from them to, you know, to do an auto renewal. No, I know what it is. But if we're for planning them up for January 1st anyway, I'm used to seeing an effective date in the esteemed case. All of these policies are going to be effective for 2026. Nothing you're doing is effective or set up for now. 2027. Correct. So we're saying is like renew and at the end of the 2026, we can order renew your policy going to all week for 2027. Right. So that should be right. Right. I see where to say. I see where to say. Yeah, there's some updates to the script that you have to do. Yeah, I should say 27. You're right. Yes, you're 100% right. That's again, there are little tiny updates that needs to be made. So the catch on Owens, very good touch. That this was a this script was for last year. So we just have to go. Yeah, exactly. We have to make some sweet, as we go. But but on online A and verification, you'll see that it, that it is asking for the, it is verbally lighting the customer know that what the effective basis. Okay, so yeah, I just brought up and saw that. But if they need for December, can we do that as well? If they need a Ford December, I want it to have a life qualifying event. So if they write, it would have a baby got the board something to do a right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you, perfect. Correct. And then they would still be another one to start on January 1. Right, we'd be doing two apps in that case, right? Exactly. Double dip. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've been wise, double dip for some. And then gentle and yeah. There you go. Yeah, come and go. I'm going to try. Correct. Yeah, I'm like I said before, you know, I'm going to, I'm going to, you know, recommend that to all downlines owners, you know, operators, managers, let them know, like, you know, that that we want everyone to be on the live document, just on the live script. So, um, so I'll work on making sure that this is this gets shared to you as a live document. So that way, any changes are made, you'll have it right there. You know, you have to do this with the open it and everything will be updated live. And front of you rather than having to be spent multiple scripts that has multiple updates, you know. So, well, we've got to do that every day, right? I'm sorry. You guys have done a little bit every day, isn't right? Well, that's what I'm presented. It is. It is. No. I don't know. Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm presenting. That's what I'm running. I'm going to get those posts of this flag and you click on the flag and download it on your, on your machine. And then you upload it. So you had that for the day, even, yeah, okay, I see. Right. I'll go on. We'll make sure we get that by tomorrow because for those of us that start on Saturday. Of course. Yeah. Of course. We're working on that tonight. Thank you. At one point, at one point, at one point in this, what point do we start application? At what point is to be, do you start the application process? Yeah, frankly, we want to. Yeah. At the point where you are at the closing of the sale, where was you likes to have your insurance cards mail to? That's where you're getting all the information to start, you know, the process of, you know, submitting that application. Do you sure? But we're going to go through the stripper process. You can get a new fruit of the rule to, you know, have a better idea of what that looks like as well. Very quickly. Oh, yeah. For when you get to the end, if an agency's a documents are required and they're not able to get those documents. That's not a commissionable sale, so they get those documents correct. That's a good point. I mean, we have to get the document because you have to think about it. Is the customer going to have coverage if they don't have the document? We've probably will work. Work out when you get paid for it. Like, so we'll ultimately charge back because if it doesn't start, we'll get paid here. You might get advanced money on it, but at some point it's going to come off one of your checks. Because if it falls up and books is a non-start, nobody got paid on it. So we would take it back from one of the upcoming checks at some point. Understood. Correct. Since we're going to have to take the checks from the phone system, the way that I've found it works best. When I could do that was the next day I said, and how would I need it? I would send them a reminder text, but if they don't send that in, they're coverage for them, and their family is going to be canceled. And they could be charged in fall. So if you tell them those things, then you might see what you need. And I want to ask you, some guys don't get a bill for me. Sure, it's comfy. They just lose the subsidy. Sometimes they cancel. Sometimes they charge them in fall, but if I say that one of those two things is going to happen, if they get everything to me ASAP, then usually I have it the next day. Correct. The best thing to do is if I got them on a phone, I just, you know, because of document due. Of course. Of course. We found it quick. It's usually the easiest, but if not again, in that sclerosis, then you're going to have the ability to use in text, messaging, community, it will be a customer. In that scenario, how do you guys typically use it in fake phone? Yeah, some of the goodies here for them. Yeah, in this year, we're going to have them. You guys are going to be getting in the dialer to see our demand dialing blood together. You're very, very able to send tech right from there. So literally you can text the customer, the next thing you need to do is you don't feel waiting on your documents, I think you can get them in. Yeah, those are our dialer training. It was pretty cool. We can send messages, text, email, everything. On the closed sale portion, if you have a premium, I mean, are we supposed to collect? We don't have to collect the credit card information if you will. We just have to ask them, hey, which payment you like to use? Be a semester card, if you don't pause it. Okay, you have to collect it. Okay, so we got to fill it out on the hillship. It'll be on. Oh, no, it's got an healthcare for its unnatural pay button. So when you enroll somebody in the application in their plan, if they have an payment due, it will give you the opportunity to pay right there. So you can click it and say, okay, I'm going to set up the payment for your right now. So it comes out so everything goes act due.

--- SEGMENT 9 (approx 80-90 minutes) ---
 say how do you want to set it up on your automatic payments you want to use a debit card credit card or check any count with the carrier right okay you'll be on that portion will see it yeah i'm gonna show you i'm gonna do a walker into your second next and ratchet the first thanks boss all right so marketplace transfer on to the next part uh for those of you that has been isn't been in this industry for a while we said not have to do marketplace transfers but uh when things turned into the wall wall west the MS has to put some measures in the place so uh i think majority of you are familiar with this process may not be um the only time you really need to do a marketplace transfer is if there is a um is if this is not a new customer like they actually have an active policy in place um but if they are brand new customer i think you could pretty much just enroll them um if i'm not mistaken but uh the uh well we were told during a lot of our initial trainings that we there wouldn't be a three way call this year in order to ensure we call this year and removed standard move okay yep so the three way calls have been removed based on based on some of the uh findings that that you've had on your end yeah our higher up um our blinds well i'll say i will say this i will say this i pray that that is true and i hope it is yeah i'm excited about it i'm just not sure if you can ask me how to tackle this he's our um i really listen listen i hope i hope i hope it is i have a good question too that's okay so really good dress that what's gonna happen is i believe if somebody is in an order you really call what if there's a policy or a reset but we're not gonna use the text and have to give you a code to unlock it that i have heard i think it won't find these decoder stuff like that to verify it most of them won't be but again we can't control that if somebody ever had an application some people will fall and say they never have an application but somebody actually enrolled them because i used to get them all at night because of the fraud in the marketplace puzzle so we're not expecting it but if you have a three-rate call we're just going to show you how to do it it's very very simple and it's an easy process so hopefully we don't run into them but if we do at least you know what to do you're not just flat and you know you're wangere but get it done okay so the so the main marketplace number is right here above looks like a c-800 318 2596 and then we have the one for door to act test as well so there there are some prompts and again this is a new open enrollment guys this is this is these these were everything down so you was from last year if there are any things it will make the updates but you know based on how it was last year you just sent it in your npm number on the t-pad you press one and then uh goal this obviously you want to clear any prior authorized agent and additional applications and then obviously you know proceed with the consent to enroll so so let's let's jump into the the prep because when you're doing these three-way marketplace calls it's important to prep the customer so that you know you can set you know the right expectations on what's going to happen on the call and what they should be doing what what they're going to be saying you know what I mean I have veterans in here I I know you guys already know the deal so let's just jump into it you know especially for those who are not familiar with this process can have a volunteer that that's very familiar with this process that could read this and again this is this action to prep the customer volunteer now even that tip is the call the marketplace and the theme authorization for this type is this allows me to be necessary of the or changes to your policy as needed though during the call they ask you to want to offer like me or just today or bring the society like choosing three types of life they are even ensure no unauthorized person can be changes to your call so I can represent and support you at any so keep in mind that marketplace retro only navigators they are in our lives of easier let me so it's important to care this thing that you want to proceed with as your life and even moving forward well be me after opinion does addition my priority even show me this opportunity as this is for you a real make sense yes all right any questions about the prep part on meant about the prepping of the customer on this part right here prepping the customer before you actually do the three wake all to the marketplace this is already done when you when you're going to have to do this three wake all yeah this is a prep so you're you're stating this to your customer setting the expectations prepping them and then you do the three wake all and obviously get a marketplace rep on the line so those of you who are not who are not familiar with this the marketplace reps it's it's like rolling the dice you do not know what you're going to get in person so I know a lot of you I know that resonates with you because man you do not know you're going to get sometimes you'll get someone super smooth all the way through the lesson lesson a couple minutes on and off everything's done next thing you know you get someone on the phone and it's like there was this they had a bad day and they just want to take it out on you so we're going to we're going to go ahead and dive into that as well but I just kind of wanted to share that you know you don't know what you're going to get um do not say go ahead well you just want to be your indictment to ever say every call is pretty much the same they're just going to be asking making sure that the consumers on the line with you um you will be it's been ever going to be asking for the application ID number the first and last name they are first but the consumer might some agent won't allow you to sneak on your behalf until you get authorization on there we have I'm sorry until you get up everything from them and then you're going to ask what state are you calling from and then pretty much you just turn them um um any authorization and also I'm just calling it to be the verification to push the environment and have them complete the environment and once you once they've got the moment you're going to refresh the application and make sure because sometimes like sister so much going to be going on with their self-realization our staff has a lot of traffic um they might be a good and you don't want to get off the phone with the marketplace called back on the marketplace try to get the customer on the back on and just be a pretty nice so I'm you should be very fine but everybody's needed why the marketplace online yeah yeah that that's that's a good point there don't don't just assume because the marketplace sets that they did everything on their end and it made you the OR whatever the game don't just assume that it's done and take their word for it yeah the refresh a few times until you actually see it done and then you can disconnect and obviously move forward so that's a really good point hey bro you're going to add on to the what you were saying please I'm so just for everybody this best sure people who's you know done this for a while the last thing you want to do with the marketplace is get off the phone with them and that's stuff being updated it's just like how brought you said sometimes people are having a bad day and for some odd reason like you will get off the phone with them and none of that stuff is updated and then what you call back they're like you're not even authorized users so all of that went through here with the client was for not you trying to call the service and I need you the worst thing you want to do is leave off that phone because they were ruined your day tell me it is right now so make sure I'll tell you I never get off the phone and so I physically see my name right after the case right yep those are just some mistakes I mean something like everybody knows who's keeping new to this do not let them off the phone until you see it actually so great yeah keep yourself in make sure that you you check everything have a pulse bit next to you with the marketplace or they will be asking for your end-pandom that's the first thing that they'll be asking you but um I would have a checklist and make sure that the authorization and company make sure that they've only been influenced make sure that they're not mature that it's in bold but I would have a little checklist

--- SEGMENT 10 (approx 90-100 minutes) ---
 The calling is a market placing. You can make sure that you have everything before you get off the phone. Yeah. I'm on our trip. I'm getting inside the bar as well. Let's go ahead and continue. Guys, so the three way market place in throw. When you're getting on the phone with a customer, this is a little bit dated. Let me see. Hello, my name is Brad. I'm a licensed agent. We're on reported line. I have, you can see on the line with us. My client would like to give 365 the authorization and finalize the application. I just submitted any please assist. I mean, it's pretty straightforward, right? On that. There's an agent node. If using a different agent of a record, submit twice and confirm that the AOR is reflected on the marketplace and on your application. So this kind of goes back doubling down on what we were just talking about. Make sure that whatever changes that you want to reflect on that application to ensure that you are receiving the credit for that enrollment. Is done before disconnecting the call. Okay. Any questions on that? Let's move along. If you see here, there's a section here. I've already addressed this with my client and discovered they don't recall the agent when rolled them in this policy and my client. Would like to authorize me as their agent moving forward. This is a statement that was added in the event that a marketplace rep tries to kind of be like difficult. And say that. Oh, there's another AOR on here. And even though you have the customer on the phone and they're still trying to make it difficult. It's like it's like, it's like, Sir, man, I've already addressed this with my client and discovered they don't recall the agent when rolled them in this policy and my client would like to authorize me as their agent moving forward. And guys, if the marketplace rep is being overly difficult. This is important that we hope everyone's paying attention. If you have a marketplace rep that is being overly difficult. And you know, you've obviously made this statement. You've tried to get it done. Don't waste too much time disconnect and speak to a new rep. And with your customer on the line, of course, disconnect with the customer on the phone say, hey, sorry, there was a, sorry, we got disconnected. Please please be patient with me. Let me go ahead and try and find another marketplace rep. It looks like the call again disconnected. Find someone else. Don't waste your time. With someone that's being overly difficult in trying to take their bad day out on you because believe me, I've heard, I've heard I've heard it all on Marketplace calls. I've even heard Marketplace reps like trying to upsell customers like I've heard the craziest things. Like I said, you don't know what you're going to get. So anything that's off, this can get another person on the phone. So have the necessary. Thank you. It's not often that you did bad engines, but it does happen. And I know my kind of overwhelming with all these phone calls and everything, but I promise it's not, it's not as complicated as this house. It's written repeat. It's not often where you get an issue, but it does happen. And we're of course we're all here to help you guys and guide you and your sister learning process. Another thing I wanted to add when it comes to authorization, the direction mentioned was, if there was a previous agent, remove the ask you only can only do it if you request it to remove the previous agent that's authorized. Because if there is more than one agent can be authorized, I'm going to count by the way. So if you're authorized and that other agent noticed we have to give this enrollment that's switched over, they can go in and take you off because they're also authorized. So make sure that you do that on the call as well. Yeah, and they will. Yeah, you know, so make sure you when you do request for authorization and you're going to try to request for one year. The different ask, are you wanting to do one phone call, this phone call or up to one year? And it's best to do one year. Because sometimes the agent, I mean, the consumer will reach out to you say, hey, you don't need to update something or for whatever reason, you can call and everything. And now how to visit three-way phone call. Once you do the authorization for one year, you can call the market place six months from now and still be able to do any updating on their application. Let's go. We should include that in this in this for a thank you. That is a good point. Very good. Thank you, girl. Thank you. Notice to notify the marketplace rep to remove the fryer AOR on on the application correct. Yes, and this happened with Paul. We had a bunch of agents and a lot of them unfortunately, they either got cancer or had heart attacks and other, another agent switch over the policy was even aware of it. The end of an hospital they couldn't even get to help if they needed it's happened. You know, so it's very, very important. That's one of the important. I mean, calls that you guys stress to these customers when you're building your relationship with them. This is a lot of fraud in the marketplace. There's a lot of people that will try to call you, the tenure from the marketplace is switch up your information. I'm trying to get you on another three-way call. Say, it's very important. You don't speak to these people and immediately contact me if somebody's trying to get you to do that. You want to put here into them, say, you want to tell them things that happened. So I always tell my customers, listen, this happened to one of my other customers. You let them file this tax issue. You want to be building a bill full of $8,000 that you owe to the IRS because somebody went into and they changed the income. And they changed it. You have the patient that I was just saying. So you want to put this fear to them because everybody fears the IRS and nobody wants to have a tax problem at the end of the year. So I always tell people, don't call for these phone calls that you're getting. You were transferred to offices in Inbound Hall. And we're going to see them. So it's important that you ask, and I can't tell you last. That's here, probably 75% of my book is on up and smoke from people still. What's the next question? Sure. We're going to be going to be with the company to the 50 January. So a lot of this one applies with us. Somebody else within the company going to take care of those questions. If you were less with the company and the difference is January. Yeah, good question. We're actually going to have a customer service team that we're going to have for a difference CRM. We're going to get everybody a full number to use across the entire group. So it knows that people want to reach back or speak to somebody on our team. They're always going to get to speak to somebody because they're going to get to somebody and they're going to come to the service department to help button everything up or keep them calm or get them transferred out to the agent that helps them. Okay. Okay, thanks. And then my quick question was, is there just some circumstances where we will have the three way calls? Because I was told that they were going away. Yeah, who did they remain a 90? We don't know for sure yet. Everything is kind of not 100% to the day actually comes and then we'll see if we could get away with it. Sometimes the system will just make you do it. And sometimes I see some recent stuff that make some send a link with a code for them to give you. Okay. So I don't know what it or what the plan is. We're going to see if we want to get going. Okay. Yeah, good question, guys. But yeah, I mean, until open enrollment, that's when the bell goes off and it's time to go, then we'll definitely have a lot more insight. But the information that we're reviewing with you right now is the foundation. Like, even if it's not the case, it's better that you know. And it's also better that you understand the process because that will help you be more equipped when you do go live. Makes sense. Right. Let's do something to stop into the button up. This is the closing. Okay. You've you've closed the sale. You verified that you went to verification. You did the marketplace transfer if applicable. Now this is pretty much. The wrapping up the column. I'm not sure if you've just bought it. After the marketplace call, guys, everything's done. And I've a volunteer. I'll volunteer. Let's do it. That bless is in the other room. Do you have any questions on what we could cover today? Nope.

--- SEGMENT 11 (approx 100-110 minutes) ---
 I left my glasses in the other room. I'm going to pass and I'll get my glasses. All right, no problem. I want to help them out. I can read it. All right, let's do it. Thank you. Do you have any questions on what we cover today? No. If any questions come up or you need assistance, you can always reach us at this number. Your health policy will take effect on what is a genuine first. Yep. You should receive your insurance cards in about 7 to 14 business days. Okay. Okay. I'll take them and keep getting them. You have a suit. Okay. It's a separate furrows. All right. So, John, the back one of my businesses based on referrals, whether it's a friend or a relative a neighbor or anyone I want to help them the same way that I helped you. Who do you know that could also benefit from my services today? What's their, what's their name? What's their phone number? That's how we, that's the best way to ask for a referral. I hear some people ask for a referral and they say, you know, the back one of them, you know, I recommend referral. So, whenever you have someone, please send them my way. You're never going to get it. Ask for it and get it right then in there. What's their name? What's their phone number? How do I reach them? All right. And, and referrals you get, you get paid on that as well, guys. So, this isn't like Medicare. Someone can give us a number. We could pick up a phone and we could call. Absolutely. So, so, if you, if you're coming from the Medicare industry, guys, remove all fear and take off all the pads and helmets. This is a whole different game, guys. Okay. That's all for me. I know. I've been Medicare, man. I know. Medicare, Medicare, you got to wear pads, helmet, lamb. You got it. Oh, my goodness. Rules, regulations. Oh, it's, this ACA is flag football, guys. This is flag football. I think you can have to open their phone. I think open your phone, go to your contacts, start up to the A's. Let's go through and see you. We can help and, you know, just get the names and numbers. Be a sub one on your left. I assume it. And then you can see the text over to him. And then he can forward that onto his friends. You know, I'm saying, you can send him a text. Your text to him and he can forward it onto his contacts. As well. Do you have your reach now? Yeah. This is more of a traditional sale, guys. So if you come from Medicare, don't remove all fear from all the regulations that you guys have to follow. This is not that type of industry. It's very, it's much more relaxed, much less compliant. We already covered all the compliance. There's nothing more. As long as you follow the process that we just covered today, all the compliance that we need is to cover has already been covered. Everything else is free game. I hope that's most, I hope that makes sense. Crystal. All right. Perfect. So I just wrapping up. There's a privacy statement. Please do not share any personal information. Unfortunately, some customer's ball victims of this by providing their personal information. But their personal details, which can lead to their plan to be in swiss or cancelled without their consent. Sometimes even resulting in tax penalties, I don't want this to happen to you. This is part of a poll. We're talking about guys. We want to state this to the customers before we end the call. So that way, we don't want these customers being flipped by anyone else. Make sure they understand what can happen and how they can follow victim. And everything here is actually true statement, especially if there is a specific, this is being done by someone who doesn't have their best interest. You know, it's good that they go ahead. Just add on to that. I know they're reserved to, you know, make some money. But at the end of day, these are people's health. A lot of people do have health issues. So it's really important to implement them not to be hearing the information. It's because sometimes people do have medications that they take. They have to be hearing specialists. They're, you know, cancer survivors. So when they're policy switches, it does affect them. So it's very important to make sure, you know, that they're not concentrating switch. And to add on before you get off the phone with them, just have them see the contact information, the phone number that's assigned to you. So they can feel some type of relationship. Where you say, hey, listen, you can text me, you can call me. This is my number. So they, you know, it's not just that random age that they're talking to. You can build a relationship with them. And it does help because when they feel like they can trust you, you do get referrals that way. They have a family friend or whatever. And you can find a call on the phone. They're a bunch of family members, a family of like, different households that are awesome. How connected to each other? Because of their building, I guess, have a relationship with them. And I told them, all right, thank you, thank you so much. I found it with my own thoughts. There we go. I started found it with my own thoughts. When I was in the Medicaid world, my dad successfully battled cancer and kept it away for 10 years. But started the process on an HMO with the $10,000 adipocate max and a lot of different copes. And my father who was in the shirt business, argued with me and I had a guarantee in his shirt for a supplement. And he could afford it. So my own father is going to debate it with me. Yeah, these customers, their experts are not everything. Well, especially ones that have been through it. But I will say an ACA, the majority, they don't really know insurance guys. You guys are the expert. There's a reason why you have your license and they don't. You know way more than them. So, you know, just your job to do that, to do right by them and, you know, guide them to get the right policy that fits their needs at the end of the day. That's what that's what we're here for. With the professionals, not them. For our travel question for you, are we going to go over some land with the agents on, like, how to read a plan correctly to how to present it to them? Yeah, that's going to be done with an Nepal. It's going to be sharing his screen. Or it leave. I mean, we're pretty much at the end of the script. At the end of the script guys, it's just, you know, once again, congratulations. Thank you for trusting and sure ACA and myself with your business. Have a wonderful day. I mean, pretty much end of call, you know, be courteous, be professional. On all the calls guys. But yeah, that concludes the, and he's an expert. That concludes the entire script guys. I'll just find a little show off the way it's here. We should keep calling you. Does anyone have any questions about what we just covered today? I know this is our first run through. I wanted this to be more of a talking point throughout the script because there is important sections, compliance wise, and reasoning behind it. You know, I just wanted to make sure that everyone was clear on the entire process from a, to the process from a to z. So it's not exactly related to the process. I'm good with that. I'm just wondering, during, um, without sharing or making sure that we set up or not, the health service is all set up. Well, we're using anti and over as for everything, right? Yes. So that's all predicated on the outline that you're with. But yes, there, there's definitely going to be opportunities for anti and over ads, depending on the state that your license stand, there will be state routing. So yes. Okay. So what, what carriers are we writing again? I know we're writing Ambedder, Blue Cross, United, Medica, I mean, pretty much the top carriers, the only carrier that I know for, fact that we are absolutely not writing and you need to avoid like the flag is gotten white. The reason why I say that is because gotten white does not pay. So all right. So you, I'm done with all NNNN over a. Yeah, that was a million of my things. What carriers are allowing NNN overize anymore? And all carriers allow NNNN overize except for Ambedder and United. Okay. So like if somebody was like, so if we didn't have, if we're not directly appointed with this agency, we can't enroll into Ambedder or United. I mean, you can if your license to sell and better in, in that state. I mean, you're not completely stopped from it. You just can't do NPN, otherwise would be better because they're better off it out. Then I know we're all doing other good if our, we might be application without having an active appointment with this agency. All that, you want to be interviewed for NPN or United. Correct. I mean, thing is that we need to make sure that there's enough active carriers that those of us who are carrier lock by, because of whatever one is in steer the other, still have enough available options. But that's my main thing is I just wanted to make sure that we, what carriers there were and is there like any carriers that we, for those of us that are in that situation might want to get and is there a November first deadline? I just want to make sure I'm getting from that. There's no good, good question. There's no deadline for carrier appointments as of that.

--- SEGMENT 12 (approx 110-120 minutes) ---
 There is no deadlines. There are still carrier appointments that are being processed. There are still carrier appointments that that are being implemented in the back end during open enrollment to open up more carriers So I would get to say then if you do have your carrier releases and got it released from your previous supply does that something I should send over to Nick? Absolutely Okay, yeah, I okay, so then get is there a way I can get the list of it just Kind of ease of mind because obviously this has been switched so crazy every you know Molina obviously being the last one to be my care We're not we're jumping out of different states so just so I'm kind of know what the available options are because I was a little Sure kind of limited by the amp better and you know that it helped your thing Yeah, we'll be sure to make sure that everyone's prepared and has all the details on that I mean, I know we're kind of we're cutting a close. I know open enrollment around the corner Right out of day So I know that's you know you guys have Salad reasons to to one ensure that you're prepared So just keep in mind that everyone's in the same boat So You're not the only one add on my end across the board every single agent I still have appointments that we're getting that we're getting submitted. We're still states getting Routing there still and pan override setups being made as we speak You know, okay, so I just I mean another agent who are kind of trying to make sure that we're starting At least doing the things that we need to so I guess if you can just touch base with me and we can Try to make sure that I do we're ready to start on Saturday Yeah, I mean we're yes, we're gonna be ready to start Saturday I'm we're working very closely with all the downline Teams and leaders and owners so You know to ensure that you know that everyone is prepared Oh, yeah, so I was talking about us specifically, but also I guess if you can message me out the feeling I appreciate it Better and you know to health care are the only two that opted out of and pan over rides there's also a list of states that Do not allow in pan over rides there's some states that Exited away from it Lord is one of them So you can can overize Michigan. Yes, so I think there's a handful But the majority of the states you can There are a few where you can't but the majority of the states we can do in pan overize as long as it is available Enough available options keep as busy. That's really all I'm married about it. That's the key You All right, let's have nothing can be that he's longer with that. All right, so I guess like I said just mess in me Let me know what I need to do Yeah, I'm pretty sure Yeah, and just to give everyone a heads up. I know and better was is like one of the biggest competitors in the marketplace I've been getting insights from You know people that I know very high up any industry giving me you know Vector insights, you know expressing that in better may not more than likely will not actually be the biggest player this year So there's going to be other carriers that will help offset You know the and better volume that we're also used to so Obviously once open enrollment starts we'll have a better idea of what that looks like so So yeah, guys, we sure this will be a very dizzy open enrollment At this point Paul I know we have to review the Sharfa So we've already Can we get a list of the states that don't accept in here now right just so I have them most of them are dating changes The only ones that are non state exchange is going to be was constant Florida and North Carolina going was it a regular impact this Okay So he Well You guys can control the routing so you don't have that My perfect so yeah, so Paul whenever you're ready you could Share your screens with that we could at least give them a visual of Sharfa and I know a lot of you are already familiar with Sharfa Those that you know maybe this is your first time seeing the the health Sharfa portal you know This is how I'll serve with this is what it will look like pretty much when you're main dashboard You'll see this so anybody that you're talking to When you get to the first part of the script as a couple questions you want to hit quote on exchange So I'm here this is what you'll look like so it's very very simple Sharfa's probably one of the smoothest easiest ones to look at it's all pretty much very transparent But I'll just show you from my zip code here These little four let's say I might do a single household that I buy myself 20k let's say 47 So in here you can build everything for your quote So if you're gonna add a spouse a dependent you would just simply click click the next box and then it's the household of four When my key Nope, this is very important Even People are in getting coverage but you're still part of household on a taxes you got to include them in the household members So they can say well I just cover for myself, okay, but you're very and you know You claim any dependence yes, you need to put everybody on the application So for instance on here when you scroll down this will give you the plans that are available For me some of my agents love So before somebody was asking about doctors and prescriptions it's pretty easy right here on the left-hand side I'm a lifter virus if they are in the world after or they're trying to see the same or certain doctor You can just type the doctor's name in my here and it will tell you if they're in there What they take So This is one of my doctors just for instance So I'll put him here I can literally just check this box and it's gonna show me only the plans that he's in So eliminate all the It's right off the bat Now in here will tell you so you can go through Obviously it's your best interest in the customer if you can get them to lowest the duck rule and the lowest out of pocket That's what you want to try to work with things going to your income and They're in the network you can see now somebody's plans you do want to check Because even though they might look good here or low deductibles I always go to plan details and the main thing I always check is What is I cost for the primary doctor visits and a specialist? So this is a good plan is flat hours and $10 and then drugs 90% of drugs are generic drugs right now So they would have a $3 pelcase for drugs This one is important for blood sugar because a lot of people get their blood work done sometimes twice a year So this one only has a $40 flat charge And then here urgent care is 50 the emergency room and stuff is for the price Now with full price means is that they're gonna pay the full price pretty much Into the deductible hits So this person has that for this policy is a $3,500 deductible So we're $3,000 deductible so pretty much if they go to the ER the first three thousand dollars of that bill is gonna be there So This one's united zero premium zero deductible So if you look on here, I'll have a drug deductible drug deductibles usually come to play on major drugs that are like Ozenfick chemotherapy those type of drugs that there's no real generic version of them right now No, a lot of drugs have generic But you can see on here so this point has a low deductible but some things It has a zero deductible but if you look to primary care visits of $50, especially 120 So some customers might say well, hey, I don't remember really go to the hospital and I run it out of the low copay when I go to the doctor so you would pick the other client for him because it was better And this one has a

--- SEGMENT 13 (approx 120-130 minutes) ---
 at $2,000 copay for a merges zero. So you've got to kind of just feel out what's more comfortable for them and what they're going to utilize more of. And then try to put them in something that needs more sense. So if I was talking to a customer, I would stick a more in this client, even though their visits are more expensive, but this plan has a lot more protection for them in the back end because if they got a hospital state that would charge, if it's outpatient procedure, something that thousands didn't $3,000. So I would try to steer my customer into something like this because it would be better for them in their interest of covering them on a day-to-day situation. Also majority of the times when you're talking to customers, it's really hard to compete against Blue Cross Blue Shield. When you try to go at a name brand, so like Molina, Oscar, United Housecare, Blue Cross Blue Shield, those of the easiest plans to push because imagine if I have to try to sell somebody a merihome over Blue Cross Blue Shield, people are going to be like, what the hell's a merihome? So sometimes even though a merihome might have a better plan, some people would just push back because they're like, no, I'll take the other plan just because it's United Housecare. And I work with a lot of customers like that too because they feel more comfortable having the big brand. Because before, if you remember, there was bright health on the market. They came and went. There was some other ones that came and went. So ultimately Molina, Oscar, Blue Cross Blue Shield, they never go anywhere. And if you choose a plan for one of these people, it's very simple. You pick up plan, hit start application. It's gonna come in here and you can do that. You can start the application. This one's just pulling up because it's not set up yet on this account. Pretty much once you go back and you do it, I'll try to pull some values here for us, me, cool. And to this whole pop up, because sometimes it tells you a brand or silver plan if you want to recommend, but I don't really pay attention to that because I just kind of work with the plans I know. Once you get your familiarized with it, so it's not most you go and I'm sure, but because it doesn't want to allow us to get in right now. Hey, Polina, that's a quick question. Yep. How does this theory and a carry on? How does well work on time? Period of carries or so of their own or already have something as far as I'm going to look during maybe a different plan or yes. So you can go in there and you can update it's just some of the carry on before they all go and they're running allowing A and Y switches. So, a load of blue is a big one for that, which means if somebody has to load a blue and area you're on to load a blue and I come along and I enroll and it's another plan will to load a blue. They don't pay. Yeah, that's specifically what I'm talking about. What pays and what does it? So they don't pay. So you're not going to run into a blue, but mostly carry is right now from what I hear they're not going to have that situation just Florida blue sticks in that they don't switch. And better, I'm united and stuff. We're doing that last year just to protect from fraud. But I heard they're not doing it this year because there's things that can place that protect the consumers from fraud. So I can't do a full walk to right now because sure if it must be updating something that is not allowing me to do the new application. But you would go in there and it's really self-explanatory when you do it. I just wish you would let me get into the start one. I don't know why I just have to speak in the message. I'm going to try to see if you're letting me work on for myself. Do you want to try from an existing? I have an existing record. You could pull up. Yeah, I'm going to try my right now. Okay. You'll go do your best to know about the Japanese job. You see, a lot of times people are probably going to have some type of application ready in the marketplace. So exactly what I just did, you're going to wind up doing because it's going to automatically throw a search on the marketplace. That screen that you just seen prior, that's automatic. Even when you quote somebody and you can start application, it's going to make you enter their information and it's going to come up and say, no application found, start into application. But if it finds an application from last year, you want to click on that and use that because it's going to pretty much eliminate all of your work because it's going to have all their information is going to carry over. And then you can go through it and do any updates that you need to be updated. So you see that I'm here, is there any going to have all my stuff pre-filled out for me? Um, Tom, can I say something really to before you move forward? Yeah. You can't move forward on the application if they do not give you their social. It won't allow. And if it's a brand new application, you have to get the social now. A lot of people say it's hard for me to get social. It's not just how you presented. Right. I always tell my customers, listening, what we're about to do is a government application with healthcare.gov. I'm fully certified with the government. You can look me up. I'm available on public information to see my licenses. But it will require your full social in order to link it to your information with the IRS, to do your application. What I like, what I've noticed, what I've done with customers, I've certainly been doing this for some time. Every year, we'll question, they're going to be asking. All of those questions afforded to the social. So for example, I already asked you hearing that the data bird. I'll ask about their address. I'll ask if they're working, how much are they working, if they're married, suggesting it's kind of awful because it's very odd. Or I can understand why they can kind of be a standoffish. It's a calling in and then immediately somebody has to walk their social security numbers. So if you kind of just, you know, if you mentioned, because you're going to ask, what's the info, what you should say, make them feel comfortable and then you can kind of ask for their social. It can't be, can't be, for that, say, listen, I really understand. And this is true. What about to tell you is, what's it with the social in and we must run it with the patient, even if it wasn't even if it was the A-Warm, it would not do the social. It will allow you. It would only allow you to do the last four. So you can just kind of come here and listen, don't want me to come here. What is that? Deep back. If you're scheduling their feedback. Yeah, I'm sorry. None of my new entire run. I apologize. What I was saying was, I know that sometimes consumers can be a little bit standoffish when it's asking for the social especially as soon as you figure it on the phone, somebody's randomly asking for their social. The time you'll know will question the ask because with these applications, the same questions, try to get them ask the questions like, you know, what's they are you in? And if you're married ask those questions, even those are going to be a little bit further into the application. So you can get them comfortable. If it's a state that you've visited and they just don't happen to live in that state, mention something about that state. Ask about the weather. Ask about their date to get them comfortable because it is kind of weird to mind that you don't know you're giving out personal information. And then you can also tell them hey, once I put in this social, it's encrypted. I will you will be able to view it. If you go back into the application, even though you are the agent or the ALR, you cannot see the social. The social only the last four. So, and you know, let them know that also it is the government website. It is the government application. It's needed and now protected the ton of affordable quarter calls for just in case I'm going to happen, you know, and just make them feel comfortable. It's all about relationship. I mean, that's the main thing. You want these people that usually you're authority, that they feel comfortable. So, they look on the, you know, certified British adhesion for healthcare.gov. And they'll build a relationship with you. Just don't sound, remember, this is auto taking. You're not really selling anything. These calls are coming in because they're looking for health insurance. So they want to sign up for healthcare.gov. Keep it that way. Make it like your order taking your customer service, you're helping them. So don't let them feel like you're trying to sell them. And you want to make it like you're helping them. Today is important, you know, do you have any doctors you work with already that you see that you want to see great, let me check it for you. Oh, you have certain medications. Okay, let me take the time. I'll look at us a couple of medications to make sure they're covered. So, oh, let me find a right plan.

--- SEGMENT 14 (approx 130-140 minutes) ---
 ask us that the questions, the bills like you're trying to help them, that you're not selling them something. And then that's going to get you along way. And when you go through this app, it's very simple. You're going to memorize it pretty much. You're going to know what's coming up. So life, she was saying, Genese, I do the same thing. I already, I have a pen and paper and for me, I so-kayed great, you know, what's the, the data birth of everybody and I get it? Okay, roughly if you had to guess, you know, all you currently work right now, and I'm already doing application while asking these questions, because I know that's coming up ahead. And I'll ask them, okay, you really have a current working, no, just my husband works. Okay, perfect. What do you think your income is roughly per year? Okay, great. Are any of the kids on Medicaid or kids care by any chance? Yes, my kids have kids care. Okay, who's looking for coverage? Just me and my husband, and I already know in my head if they're like, okay, how much do you make? I make a hundred thousand a year. Okay, just so you know, when we put down a hundred thousand dollars a year, your kids are no longer going to fall for a kid care, so I need to find a plan for everybody to be on. So that gives you a opportunity because obviously you're getting more people enrolled, it's better, it gets a lot of kids when they're a Medicaid, they're limited to certain doctors they can see, they don't have the same privilege as going to a blue, cross blue shield doctor network as being a Medicaid. So I try to tell people, you know, some people say, well, my kids on kids care, people, you make a hundred thousand years they're going to lose it, so let's find a good plan for them now. And we have, oh, what do you mean you're going to lose it? And I explain to them once you do your application and it updates the income, it's going to take away your kids off Medicaid. So I helped them out and I kind of educate them, but once you know those type of things, what's coming, you can ask ahead of time and you're fast at 3D application. And on this part, we'll see here, it already has my address. If it didn't have my address, you put your address information in there. And if it continues, I mean doing a help shirt by application is very, very simple. It's literally step by step, it tells you what you need. I always put in here to send paper notices by mail because a lot of people don't check their emails or they don't check their taxes, they think it's spam and they might get a letter that's going to cause them to lose their coverage. So I always put some, they get a hard copy in the mail so they can't say, I never got it. And on here, you obviously had who's applying, you would click on that, if it's already pre-filled out for you, it's good. You can choose the information, you can edit everyone of these screens. If it's a brand new screen, obviously you're going to go in here and put it in and I'll click on it just to show you. So you would put on here, if you're eligible for the cost savings, this always has to be yes. If you select that no, they're never going to get approved. Then you're going to add the rules looking for coverage. If anybody is Medicare eligible, you can select it. Obviously they're not on Medicare because you wouldn't even get to this level if they said they were on Medicare. And then here's some time from the ad family members. It makes you link who's who, as far as the parents of the child and the siblings. So you just have to pay attention to that part. Then it makes you confirm that everybody at that address is living in debt address. That's important because everybody has to be in a household. The only time you can get exceptions to that is if there's a child that's in college it's still covered under the plan. And pretty much if you have to choose if they file taxes for 2025. Remember, somebody asked a question before about 2025. So this is for up-and-coming, do you plan? And it's not asking if you did. It's asking you plan to file taxes. So you always have to put yes because if somebody is not planning on filing taxes, they don't qualify. And then it's going to ask you if you're filing a joint. If you answer this note, they will not get approved. They have to buy law in order to qualify for health care.gov. If there are husband or wife, they have to file jointly. If you choose no, it keeps them right out. They don't qualify. Now, you can tell somebody to say, hey, on health care.gov, you will already file jointly with your spouse. However, at the end of the year, if you're accountant to size, it does not your best option. We are not accountants and we do not give information on that. Whatever your accountant decides to best option for you, that's what we do at the end of the year. There's no penalty for them not filing jointly, but they're expected to file joint. So if you account at the end of the year, suggest that they shouldn't file, that's on them. You have nothing to do with it. And then obviously here, if they're claiming dependence, if you see yes, it will pop up, put the dependence are and you just have to check the boxes on it. So you put them in as part of the household. Then it's going to ask you about the kids and stuff like that if they're married and they're information about them. You're going to ask you about other relationships. So if you have any other children that you're taking care of that aren't in the household, it asks you. Can you just look at the other? I know. I'm just going through the actress's show in different options. There's a back a little bit of anybody else on the age of 18. You'll see all different questions that I'll ask you in there because it depends on the age of the children sometimes to ask other questions. Then this part, it asks you if they smoke tobacco or not, I always put no because healthcare adoptive doesn't have any restrictions. You know, somebody you can be talking to, you can have HIV right now. They can have cancer. They come if you don't matter what. So I always put no. You can put yes. Whatever you want on that question. They have to, you have citizenship in order for all the time. Always put no, though, because they could affect their premiums. Yeah, and the more the higher their premium is, you know, then that impacts the qualification that they have on the sub-stities. So you could go from zero dollar premium to flicking yes on smoker. And then they have to pay out of pocket and now you gotta get a credit card. So for actually, I always put no, it's all because it's about 100%. Yeah, 100%. And then here, after American Indian ambassador, Alaska Native, I always put no because if they are, they don't qualify for healthcare.gov. Also, if they're incarcerated, they don't qualify for healthcare.gov. On this part, if there has Hispanic or Latino, I usually don't ask people because it's optional. So I just skip it. I always go decline decline. And then it's going to ask for the same questions for each person. After that, at the end, you're going to get to an income section, the income section, it's going to be very self-explanatory. What is going to ask you is, what your job is, if you're self-employed, you're W2, it's going to make you just put your company name and pretty much their income on there. I usually don't break it down to hourly. I just do it by a yearly. It's the quickest and easiest way. So I usually just choose year and I put that how much they make for year. And then after you get to there, it's going to go to additional questions, which I was trying to see if it will skip or it doesn't want to miss you to it. So you can have to go through this real weird. This makes for the income matches what you spoke with the customer about on a recorded line. Also guys, just saying no, some people could say they make 300,000 a year. It matters what their net income is. So I always specify that to everybody. And I mentioned it just like this. They say, look, you could be self-employed, or make 300,000 dollars a year. All that matters is what your net income. You remember what your adjusted gross income was on your tax return. That's all they care about is what your adjusted tax is because that's what your income is. This is pretty much the same question. This is just the over and over for each child they do the same thing. So for instance, here is the income. It's going to ask you, does Paul get income? Yes. Tell us about your income. Self-employed 5,000 a month. I just make it very simple. If they're W2, you'll be able to put W2 in there. You can simply go in and if it's a new application, it will give you a drop down where you can add and change the income. And then it will ask you here, did they have any deductions? I always put no, because if you start going into each itemized deduction, you're not an accountant. I would recommend that you don't do that. It's too complicated. It's easy to just go all off or whatever they're adjusted gross income is divided by 12 months, break it down, and then simply put no deductions because they're giving you their average.

--- SEGMENT 15 (approx 140-150 minutes) ---
 you're adjusted gross and then you just put yes that that's their income and you make sure you go over with the customer again, Mr. customer you're stating your income is $60,000 a year that income yes okay perfect. And obviously no one else in my household works so if nobody works you don't even know anything for them. Hello and then this section here. Hey, you have fast. Does anybody have any mental disabilities or unable to answer their questions or you know, have any special needs? If they do you have to check it for them. Hopefully nobody does. And same thing here with medical nursing facilities. Yeah, this part is a different question about Medicaid or kid care. So if they receive the letter that they would that they're getting qualified for Medicaid, you say, you don't need to do this. We want to take 15 minutes and I just share something really quick. Yeah. So guys. Okay. Everything that all the information that you've gathered from the public is read. I'm zoomed on you as you say that the day pretty much already have it. So when you're going through to healthcare.gov the trap that I don't want you to fall into. Okay. Can I do this in an average with auto agents? What's your turn, sir? Oh, call. That's it. Really be 20 minutes. No, not good. And that's even if there's a three way marketplace call. This would really be like a 15 to 20 minute call. I've seen those calls turn into an hour plus because now all of a sudden the Asians asking every single question that Paul's going through. That's you're not supposed to be doing that. Yeah, you want to live in your beginning when you're doing that script part. You want to try to not everything out ahead. You want to know the answer. So what actually might be this? I literally, what I do in Romans, it takes me less than seven minutes to complete the Roman. A lesson to large family. That's the only time you run into issues. Well, hang on. I got to go find my kid's social. Hang on. I got to look this up. That's the only time it gets a little complicated. If there's no application in there. But if it's a one or two person application, they have everything ready. And I can tell them that when we're doing application, I say, these script part. When it first call, I say, okay, great. Are you going to be setting this up for a family or individual? Okay, do you have everybody's information like their data birds, their socials? We're going to need that because it's a government application. Yes, okay, perfect. I'm already moving along with it. And I'm usually writing down, okay, hey, mother, how many kids you have two? Okay, boy, your girls girl. Okay, what's your data birth? And I'm writing it down so I can know it's what I get to that part. I can just throw it in quick. What did I get into it in on the CRM? Correct. Instead of writing it, just type it in the CRM. That way you have a right there in front of you and you can pop in the pace. But you want to move quick because remember, this is your money. At the end of the day, yes, you're helping people, but you want to try to knock out 20, 30 deals in a day. That's how you get, that's how you make your money. That's how you're going to eat. This is open enrollment. You know, yes, you want to help people, which I'm all about helping people. But you don't want to also do it where you're just moving out a little pace. You want to do it where you streamline is maybe the first couple of apps. You'll drag your feet, but once you realize that it's repetitive, you should fly right through this. And then this is going to ask you these type of questions. Does anybody have an existing health coverage on here? You could put yes if it's going to end. So is it helped to ever get an end before the December 29th? Then I think yes, that's only thing if they have a current application. If they don't have an application, then you just answer no on everything. Either additional questions that I will ask, I never answered one of these in my life. I also never answered one of these in my life. So you're not going to have anything to do with that or these. This is if they already have employee coverage. Now if they were, I usually don't even put it down because it's only the way that you can offer somebody coverage. If they are on group insurance or have the ability for group insurance. So it's about 8% of their income per month. I usually just rounded off the 10% so what that means is if somebody's getting offered group insurance is going to cost them $400 a month. That they have to pay for group insurance but they only make $2000 a month. They don't have to take their group insurance because it's costing them more than 10% of their income. That makes sense to you guys if you catch that. So again if somebody is getting paid $2000 a month but the health insurance through their companies costing them $400 a month. They don't have to take it because it's costing more than 10%. So that's the case which you can establish at the beginning of the call with the customer because I always ask them. They are currently working or they're going to offer you any insurance for your job. Yes. Oh they're given it to me for free. Well then you don't qualify because you have to take the group insurance if it's giving you for free. I can't roll the rest of your family but I can't roll you because you're getting offered insurance at no charge from your company. By the face of you, my company is giving me health insurance but I have to pay for it. It's very expensive. Okay how much is it? I'll just $400 a month. Okay but your income is only $2000 a month. Okay you don't have to take it. And then I just skip this section right here because they already don't have to enroll. Well that's a total affordable coverage. She's an affordable workplace coverage. What you're describing. Yeah it's on affordable coverage. Yeah. And then here this is only realistically if they're losing coverage this is not really applying to open enrollment because you don't need a life changing event. This is only if they have that a life changing event for something you don't have to pay for. And then pretty much here you have to if they had a policy last year. This is going to actually update them. So this is probably going to say 23 24. I'm sure by open enrollment. But that was the question before that somebody asked you is you have to check this box because if they got a premium tax credit and they didn't file it tax return they're not going to get approved. So you have to make sure you choose that if they had a tax credit last year they have to put that they use and file their tax return using their tax credit. And then all you do is simply hit next. And you're just going to make sure everything looks good. And at this point once you get forward I'm usually asking the person hey by the way I'm going to be your agent that's assigned to you. And I have your consent to do your renewal for 2027 as well as that correct. They say yes. I check and rewrite here. That's in verification so they can just check and greet because everyone's going to read the verification script. Exactly. So you'll have that part. Same thing right over here. I always double up that I have consent to sign your application. So I don't even read any of this to the customer as far as the tax part. I just skip over it because I already got it on there from there part of the script. But over here I always reconfirmer. I always say, okay again Mr. Greenberg. My name is John. I have your consent to sign your application heavily or enrollment this year. And just give me a food for the record state your name that you give me consent for 2026 enrollment. And they say yes. My name is Paul Greenberg. I give you consent. And I just clicked this page the right here and then it's going to lie to choose plan once you go after that. Obviously it's not going to do it from here right now because there's no plans available. But once you click that it's going to open up the door for you to add a plan to the cart. And if you're already put a plan in the cart from before, then it's going to lie to continue the enrollment. Now you might have to change the plan because maybe their subsidy is going to change based on what you put at the beginning of the application. So you might just want to double check what plans are available to make sure if you were giving them a zero cost because when you get through the application. You might have quoted them as your cost at the beginning. And by the way, I never tell anybody numbers at the beginning. So I never tell anybody hey congratulations you're able to get you know 100% subsidy when you're doing a quote. I do that at the end after I finish the application and everything is approved. That's when I tell the customer hey Mr. Jones great news you're getting a full subsidy wherever you get you full coverage put that plan. You're going to have no out of pocket monthly premiums because your associates are going to cover everything for you. And by the way, because it's open enrollment it does allow you to get other products now. So if you need anything like dental insurance critical illness, you have the opportunity to do that now during open enrollment. And then that's your ability to sell any add-ons after that as well. So pretty much you can get through that part. I wish I can take it through again. What we probably do is we can do a call on Saturday if we want just a one one application real quick. To show you once the plan is already there. And don't think this is going to show me the plan. Some of them I ran on yesterday you did, but not everybody is. Let's see if it does. What may we get lucky. So I do have to go in here this year and update up with the income because being there.

--- SEGMENT 16 (approx 150-160 minutes) ---
 less subsidy health this year. Some of the incomes you might have to play around with in order to get the everybody covered where somebody is in your put on Medicaid. Again, we're not a count on this. I have some customers I make $300,000 a year. You know, they tell me I just put in $25 or $30,000 or $50,000. You know, because they like to deal with the taxes themselves at the end of the year because they write off certain things and write up the functions. So if that's what somebody puts date, that's what they want to tell me they're income is. That's their income. I can't control what they want to say and what they don't say. The only time you need to kind of advise somebody if they don't have enough income. Sometimes you talk to somebody and it's a single person they say I make $12,000 a year. Okay, well $12,000 a year. You won't qualify for free health. And then sometimes that's $12,000 doesn't allow them to get Medicaid because they make too much. So you got to tell them what order qualify for health care. I go if you got to make at least 16 or 18,000 to find out in the state. So I tell them is there any possibility that you can have extra income, possibly your in a cost of the year. You don't have to make it, but if you have the chance to make it, we have to include it. So I got to keep screwing with this because. Paul, what is um. When if they don't have employment in the state to the day and between jobs. That's why it's if they don't they don't have to have employment currently. It's just with it projected to make for 2025. 2026, sorry. So you can tell somebody listen it's not right now if you're not working that's fine. But when you normally work, how much you make for the year? I know I'm when I'm working. I'm a waitress and no man make 25,000 here. Okay, perfect. So what we'll do is we'll put the 25,000 now because you're going to be looking for a job as being a waitress somewhere else. And if you go back to work and that you want to make more money, you need to let me know right away so I can raise the income. So you don't have any penalties at the end of the year. Sorry, guys. Just make a me play with the income. Do you want to do my application? I'm not just job all the time. Just repeat. Because of little less substance health this year. Sometimes you have to do this by the way, so I always suggest that you kind of get familiar with the states that you're working with. You'll start to learn as you go. That hey, Florida to be a family of four. They got to make at least 70,000 a year to get everybody covered in not get thrown on Medicaid. Like enough Carolina usually it's over like 22,000 or 23,000 to get a single person to be covered in not get put on Medicaid. So you'll start making like little notes. You know when I first started I have little sticky on my thing and I would write the state. And usually with the minimum was the person. Quick question. Yeah. Sorry, I just re-rebounded because you were talking about the members. Whether it comes to the commission part. Is it. Are we going based off of the application or for member. So every team is is going to structure it a little different. I'm really not able to say who's going to do what because some people are putting their their agents on how we're salaries. Some people are paying commission. So it's that would be your your team that you're on that you guys would have to work with your your agency owner to see whatever they put. Yeah, no, so multiple train. Okay, I'm so yeah. Yeah, no, okay. We got like well there was like 60 people in here. No, it's down before you won. Okay. It's a bunch different. Okay. These are all different agents different teams. We're just kind of doing this to get the script and. Okay. My father. My father. So I think a lot of little bit to get this qualified for open enrollment for the new year. New subsidies. So before 60,000 was more than enough for a family of four. So this year I used to have a zero deductible in my previous plan. And I used to pay thirty seven dollars a month. So now this year I have a shitty deductible and I have to pay double them when I paid before. So I would go in here and change the plan. So that's why I never give anybody a price at the beginning. I always tell them at the end because you might have to go in there and tweak it. To get something to qualify or to get it right. And if you shoot yourself in the foot at the beginning when you run the quote and you say, Hey, great news. I got you zero. And then you get through the application and all of a sudden they got a 30 dollar payment. They come back. What happened to zero? You can always go down and you can't go up. Yeah, that's a good point because sometimes that happens. It'll show zero when you do the initial quote guys. And then the moment you go all the way through the application, you put all the information. You go through everything that all the steps in in Shrepa. Then it'll actually sometimes that premium can change. So that's a really good point. You don't want to that'll completely delay the customer and jump.
