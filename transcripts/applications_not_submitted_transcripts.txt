TRANSCRIPT:
Good afternoon.  Good afternoon.  Good afternoon.  Good afternoon.  This is my her and I have been  for lady with me and H.  F.  She's 60 years of age and the  zip code is 7 or 7, 2, 3.  Please provide the  quotation on final expense.  Check out the call and you both have a good day.  Thank you.  You too.  Hello and how you doing this is Yanto Reyes.  The agent of time helps you out today.  I understand you're looking for life insurance coverage.  Correct?  Resin up, get breaking up.  Okay, okay. Sorry about that.  How are you?  Are you hearing me a little bit better now?  Yeah, hello.  Okay, excellent.  So I understand you're looking for...  I'm here.  No, I told him I was going here, but he has a seat.  Okay.  I mean, just saying something about, he was saying something about the fine experience  you go for all the money and he could answer me when I had H.T.M.  Yeah.  Because they have the policy for you to borrow from me.  Gotcha.  Is that the kind of insurance you're interested in, the kind you can borrow from?  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  So let's look into that.  Now, do you know the difference between the whole life?  So, whole life you can do that with however for accumulation.  We usually use the index, the index type of life insurance.  Do you know the difference between those two?  The index?  Yes. You know the difference between the whole life and the index universal life.  So one is whole life and one just whole life.  Right.  So let me quickly and I'm just, I'll give you,  I'll give you a quick explanation of index.  So the reason we usually use index  is that for that type of purpose is because  it accumulate faster than whole life.  Now even though the index is not necessarily  designed to be a permanent product, you can use it that way.  So it can be just like a whole life where you have it  for your entire life.  The difference with the index universe of life  is that it is also attached to what's called an index  in the market.  So in this case, some of them use S&P 500,  do you know what S&P 500 is?  So S&P 500 is a portfolio of the top 500 companies in the US.  So it participates in that.  And the cool thing about that is when the market goes up, you participate, and you get  a higher percentage on the money that you have in that account.  And but when it goes down, your money stays safe.  So it never goes below zero.  You get caped off if like, if the market goes really high 20%.  You are getting caped off with some companies somewhere around 9%.  Some companies 10, some companies 12.  But when it goes down below zero, it doesn't disappear like a 401k.  You know, we've all heard those horror stories about 401k's that suddenly  disappear because of market crashes, right? So this doesn't happen with with this type of  life insurance. So you have the benefit of being able to accumulate at a faster rate.  So whole life accumulates usually somewhere around 3%, 3.5% but in the index universal life  you're able to do a little bit faster because you're able to go up to 9 sometimes 10,  sometimes 12 makes sense. Yeah. So the tricky thing about the quality that you're talking about.  Right. So the tricky thing about those is that you have to be in really good health. So how's your health?  That easy out.  Are the things you're taking on a daily basis for any conditions? Do you have any  Do you have any problem with anything like that?  No, I don't.  And she just, okay, diabetes, or I can't stop.  Or there's, there's any problem with diabetes.  Neuropracy because of the diabetes, okay.  So that is instant.  I don't know.  That's instant.  They're going to throw off that option.  I understand, yeah, but it doesn't mean that whole life is bad. I mean, you can still, you can still borrow with whole life. I simply offer that option because usually when people are looking for that kind of thing where it's more focused on the cash value, you're able to accumulate faster. That's the only reason I mentioned it. But you certainly can use a whole life policy for that purpose.  Let me take a quick look in here and see what you told me the age is 62 correct?  No, 60.  60.  OK.  60.  OK.  OK.  So let's take a look in here.  I'm going to put you on a brief hold when I look in the market.  OK.  I'll be right back with you.  Okay, no problem.  And where do you diagnose diabetes before turning 50 or after 50?  Before.  Before.  Okay.  At one age, where you diagnosed?  22, 22, I'm not deaf.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay, bear with me.  I'm taking a look at the room.  I'm taking a look at the room.  I'm taking a look at the room.  Okay.  Okay.  When you're able to get rid of diabetes, raw.  Okay.  So, I'm sorry for the health questions.  This is to better be able to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to  hold down on the ones that would accept you, okay?  So, when did you begin to develop to neuropathy?  No, no, I mean, I think it's about changing the physical.  Okay.  Okay.  There with me a moment, be right back.  And that while the system is doing its thing, I'm going to send you my credentials.  Okay, this is part of the process whenever I help people out.  I'm required to send you my credentials.  So first I'm going to send you this number that you're on 985-51845.  Okay, excellent.  So, I just sent you my name.  This is just to make sure I'm sending to the right person.  I don't want to send my pictures and licenses  to the wrong person.  You're much as I've gotten this to Apple phone.  You should have gotten that message.  Check it.  Check if you got it now.  I'm going to keep checking here.  You didn't reach the right person.  Hello, can you I'm sorry can you say that again?  You sure name or EY? Yes, yes, yes, there you got it excellent. So here what have just sent you is my  version  Yenta I know  Oh, nobody nobody just nobody gets that one on the first one  Don't worry, okay, so I just sent you my license,  you know, my producer license, I'm floored on base and floored  up, but I'm license in across across America, okay?  Now, okay, taking a look for you in here, I apologize for the way  I'm having to refresh my system here.  Oh, there's a Warren B. I'm playing my game.  They have an addition to that.  It's called, yeah.  Never want to see another damn business.  Okay, and that.  So here's what I found now.  I am, I am, okay, like I said before,  so I'm looking at the whole marketplace.  Now, there is a company here that with your condition,  they would take you on,  because the problem is that you know the companies are going to decide that you are a risk factor with your with your condition.  So I'm seeing them start at around for about $20,000.  I'm seeing them start somewhere around the $80 mark.  Is that do you want me to check higher or lower the tax?  Okay, so let's try for 10.  Let's try for 10.  Okay, so for 10, for 10, we're looking at something a little a little more around under under $50.  You want me to check higher?  I have much under $50.  So we're running every year for the 647.  Does that sound like it would fit your budget monthly?  No, I don't know.  I'm going to do like I just went to the other guy that still will run in me too.  I have enough life insurance, because I have four probably shes on myself.  Oh, that's all I'm doing.  I have something with that.  Understood.  Now, explain what to the first desk.  You know, each other says, just talk to the man.  Just talk to him.  I'm like these people.  Don't give him a visit again.  I understand.  I understand.  I understand.  So they kind of, they kind of trusted your arm there.  OK.  Yeah.  Well, Nick, yeah.  What was going to be?  Rules.  The other, I understand.  And I appreciate that.  There's another thing that you can also do now.  they the index universal life that you were talking about in the beginning.  If that was something you wanted to you are allowed to take that out on your children.  If they are healthier and you feel that it would be a better idea to get it through them.  And you can be in my children.  My children is not healthy.  Oh, okay.  My son have not had the high blood pressure, my daughter have that.  My grand baby is as well.  I'm going to get her out.  The grandchildren, your grandchildren, your grandchildren.  Yeah, not granddaughters. Very healthy.  Okay, okay. Well, that would be something that you might want to consider because you are allowed to take out a policy for her.  Obviously, you wouldn't have the benefit of the death benefit.  you're saying that goes up to the  night period. Yes, yes. Yes, they can go  they can go to the police. They can go  even lower than that, actually. Some  companies go as far as Newborn. Now, you are  a little bit out though. I have a whole life  to tell my granddaddy and it is  everything.  She said, Richard, sir, Nathan.  Go, Rob.  You see.  Right.  Okay, sir.  You know, the same price.  No, no, it's not.  It's not just that.  It's just that.  It's like, like, like, I, uh, she had, I started her out with 10,000.  And when she was turned 18, I knew that she had, which, so it's what I'm like, you  keep reading them and sharing them.  I can't get the kind of thing.  So when I talk to them, they say,  know she can 18 they change. I have to all this slide. I think it's for money.  Is that the only time it's going to be?  I think she's seen it change every other year or something like that.  That amount. But the payments gave the same.  And you're okay the payments say the same but the what changes is the is the the death  The fit is what you're saying okay, okay, I end the beginning of what's saying is that the price was going up  And when the price is going up then that's not a whole  The price stays the same that's why I was  When you told me that  Yeah, no, well listen  So what I was saying is for your granddaughter, you are able to take one out under her name,  and you're able to be the owner.  She can be the owner.  And you would be able to use that cash value in the way that you were saying before,  where you can borrow off of it, okay?  If that's something that you would like to consider.  I'll be with that.  I'm here.  Can you hear me?  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hey, I'm here.  Every time I'm on the phone, somebody's calling.  Okay, hear me?  You still there?  Yeah, I'm here.  Yeah, yeah.  My phone was ringing.  Oh, okay.  Thank you.  Okay.  Okay.  This phone is ringing.  It's a seven-third.  It's a small one.  So how far do you have?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the same as when you think of what it would look like for you.  Yeah, and she got much idea.  You told me, you told me she's tall, she's 18?  No, she's 19.  19, okay, so let's check it out real quick.  I'll be the 20 in January, oh, wow.  That means she's my goodness, she's not 23.  Hi, that means she was a thousand four thousand four okay  The she worked  There's a different tool that I'm getting fired up in order to check for the I-UL for her  OK, so bear with me. I'm logging in  I'm checking things out.  Yeah, my baby, very healthy.  Thank you.  I'm going to do a just crack.  I'm pretty sure she's healthy.  Really?  Just here.  Yeah, for the same thing,  you got that.  You just are all right.  I love her.  I don't even want my grandia thing.  Yeah, yeah.  It runs into family, huh?  You're so, you can tell you how healthy she is.  I bought her outfits for her 11th birthday and she still finished.  I said, which states did you say you were in?  Who is Indiana?  Gotcha. Okay, Louisiana.  And then, you know, my favorite, my favorite, I'm like, what's that?  Yeah.  You know, damn, but he's asking a lot of people not bought it,  you've done. Okay, I'm getting that calculation here done. There with me a second and I will let you know exactly what this looks like. So I did  did I'm doing the illustration for a hundred thousand dollars okay, let's see what we get at a  night for a hundred thousand. Now obviously you know we're not really that concerned about the  the death benefit because this is a babe, a 19-year-old baby, we're nobody's counting  on her, anything happened to happen to her.  We're looking at this solely for the cash value aspect.  Okay, so for 100,000, it's coming out somewhere in the vicinity of $70.  Let me go with something a little lower and let's see what we get.  I'm going to cut that in half just to see what it looks like.  I'm turning it into 50.  Yeah.  Wow, getting out of the lighting.  Oh, and here we go.  Okay.  So here's what 50,000 looks like for her.  It's coming out.  $37 and some change.  Does that sound like anything?  Does that sound like something doable to you?  I have, you call me back in the, in the, what?  both of these more than these in June.  So I guess you would be taking out without the insurance.  So I could say, well, I have enough to do that.  Right. Because I have loved the insurance.  In my study and for her and my whole job.  What? My great name is the Abinaya.  I have policy.  And the ones who are seeing the mobile option.  Okay, so the one that you were around,  when you were around,  oh, I just,  when she was born,  and not over.  Oh, okay, so you had it for a really long time then.  Well, then you already,  you should already have some cash value in that policy, have you checked?  Me, not.  Okay, well,  I'm really curious to hear you.  That's the next thing.  That's what I'm saying.  You've changed.  Like I said, I have set up on the third, but a lot of them people don't take out on the third.  I'm not what they have to be thinking about.  But once I have that change in our dossier was what?  I'll leave it all to you then because right now I want to see you see you draw on a regular road and don't do it  Yeah, so let's do that. I don't know that. You have my number here  Find your policy and I can help you out. Let's read it. Let's go through your policy together to check out exactly who you would see  Okay, I'm ready to move.  Oh, please.  Everything on the floor.  You gotta get down.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  No, no.  Okay.  So that'll be moved to Ohio.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  I'll move the child.  Hold on.  Yes.  I can't.  I came there for myself being a motor doctor for you.  I got you.  I got you.  Okay.  There's no other person.  I can't grow them down with this.  Yes.  You.  Tom.  When did that move happen?  Would you say darling?  You back.  Step temper.  Okay.  Now I want you to call me back this for a step temper.  I can feel what I got happened to.  I got to have to stay in the Reset of the Gipershatch.  No, no, no, no, no. No, you're fine and Ohio.  I'm fine. I'll see.  I'll say, you know, give me a call back.  Okay. We could go from there and see, but everything comes.  You said again.  You want me to call you the second week of June?  That's fine. That's long.  All right.  I see a lot of people, you know, you should try to teach it out.  That's on the third day on the other day.  Okay.  Yeah.  So let's take look at those first because, you know, if you've been taking those for a long time with your conditions,  I might immediate recommendation.  Like if you were my mom, I would tell you to keep the one that you have if you've been paying it for a long time.  because what they're gonna do is they're gonna put you on waiting periods for getting new policies, okay?  So, well, I'm going to keep the ones that got because keep those on their heads.  You go back, go up, go up, and get me a new one.  Or a part of that piece, I think $9.  Yeah.  And you've been paying that part a lot.  I've been so proud of this, it's all my stuff.  Yeah, that's awesome.  That's great.  I got more than four pounds to go on myself.  I think about six.  Yeah.  I'm going to check that and then take a month.  I think we're getting out much better.  Because I'm just sitting here thinking about it for four,  probably since it's 79, that's my two-poomie.  And two-poomie, go out now.  And then I have a policy that's all that's been dollars.  The day just over there, but this is all I have about the policy work.  I'm going to do the shit.  But I'm going to take care of the two.  I think about my kids.  I don't want them to go on to nothing.  You know, I love my children and I do not want to put them through all that heat.  I hear you. I told them, I'd be cremated to not have a damn feeling in all that  question you don't let shit. So they can have shit. Yeah, yeah, that's the way I'm going  to do it too. Because it's all making a shit. My brother's eye and my mama had to  $500, but then I'm going to open the damn ground when the package is being paid up.  She was a job guy, so my grandmother took about $10,000 for all her children.  I'm like, this is pretty crazy. $500,000 just to put a damn hole in the garage.  You can call me after the damn hole in the ground.  I told my children I was recreating.  Don't worry about no damn.  You're in the room because you don't know why my parents are talking like bullshit.  That's the way I look at it.  Yeah, they're getting bigger and bigger now.  They're getting bigger and bigger now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm changing about junk.  Some people haven't told them.  You only see all that crap.  Yeah, I'm going to give you a call back during that second week of June, okay?  Okay, I'm going to be very, very pleased.  Yeah, to give you time to be settled in and then we'll look at the options for the IUL, okay?  Okay.  Alright, alright it's been a pleasure in that you take care.  Sandy's all in.  Bye bye.

I have a whole life to tell my granddaddy and it is to reach a certain age and goes up and he comes. Right, okay so I know which oldels Charles is shifting his page. Right, George is saying, he's like she's gonna start artavioring art seriously, and when she ho! I'mei from 10 Corinthians, which was why they like, if they've writtened them and share and they can't sign up for it. know she can 18 they change. I have to over the slide. I can't wait for money. But is that the only time it's going to be? I think she's seen it change every other year or something like that. That amount. But the payments do the same. And you're okay. The payments do the same. But what changes is the death effect, is what you're saying. Okay, okay, I end up being a press. What's going up and when the press is going up, then that's not a whole new one. No, no, no, no. The price stays the same. That's why I was shocked when you told me that. Yeah, no, we'll listen to what I was saying is for your granddaughter, you are able to take one out under her name. and you're able to be the owner. She can be the owner. If you as the owner and you would be able to use that cash value in the way that you were saying before, where you can borrow off of it. OK? Hello? If that's something that you would like to consider. Hello, sir. I'll be with that. I'm here. I'm here. Can you hear me? Shut up, oh, no. Shut up. Hello? I'm ready to be my guest. Hey, I'm here. Every time I'm on the phone, somebody could count the call. Okay, hear me? You still there? Yeah, I'm here. Yeah, yeah. My phone was ringing. Oh, okay, thank you. Okay. This phone is ringing. It says seven, 30, just move on. So, how far did you get? Yeah, you said seven, one, you didn't go. See what it would look like for you. Yeah, and you got much to do it. You told me she's telled? She's 19? No, she's 19. 19, okay. So let's check it out real quick. I'll be the 20 in January. Oh, wow. That means she's my goodness. She's not 23. Hi. That means she was 24. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm going to show you what you're doing. Okay. So, this is a different tool that I'm getting fired up in order to check for the I. I'm working in. I'm checking things out. Yeah, my baby, very healthy. Thank God. But you know, do you just crack pretty good. She's healthy. Really? Just yeah. Yeah, for the same thing, you got that. You just all right. I love it. I don't even want my grandia that. Yeah. It's nothing to run into the family, huh? You're so. Let me tell you how healthy she is. I bought her, uh, uh, I'll fit for her 11th birthday. And she's still a bit. I said, which state did you say you were in? Louisiana. Gotcha. Okay, Louisiana. And then, yeah, my favorite still a bit near. I'm like, what's that? Yeah. Yeah. You know, okay, but you guys, you've been a lot of healthy product, but when you've shown you, you haven't worked to these. Okay, I'm getting that calculation here done. There with me in second and I will let you know exactly what this looks like. So I did it. I'm doing the illustration for $100,000, okay? Let's see what we get at a 90% discount, a 100,000. Now, obviously, you know, we're not really that concerned about the death benefit because this is a babe, a 19-year-old baby. baby, we're nobody's counting on her, anything happened to happen to her. We're looking at this solely for the cash value aspect. Okay, so for a hundred thousand, it's coming out somewhere in the vicinity of $70. Let me go with something a little lower and let's see what we get. I'm going to cut that in half just to see what it looks like. I'm turning it into 50. I think it's a little bit of a big deal. I'm getting out of the lighting and here we go. Okay. So here's what 50,000 looks like for her. It's coming out. $37 and some change. Does that sound like anything? Does that sound like something doable to you? I'm going to call me back in the, what? both of these more fat kids in June. So, I guess you would be peeking out without the insurance. So, I guess you would have enough to do that. Because I had loving insurance in my study and for her and my whole family. What? My grandmother had a policy. And the ones who were watching, the ones who were watching. Okay, so the one that you were around around, or just to where she was born in October. Oh okay, so you had it for a really long time then. Well then you already, you should already have some cash value in that policy. Have you checked? Me, not. Okay, well, I'm really curious to hear you. That's the next thing. That's what I'm saying. You're changing, like I said, I have a setup on the third, but a lot of them, people don't take out on the third. I'm not what they have to be thinking about. But once I have the change in our dossier, what's what? Give me, I'll, they even talk to you then because right now I want to see you see you draw on a regular road and don't do it Yes, so let's do that. I don't know that. You have my number here Find your policy and I can help you out. Let's let's read it. Let's go through your policy together to check out exactly Because I'm move. Oh, so everything has the chance. You gotta get down. Wait, wait. Okay. Okay. No, no. Yeah. So that'll be moved to Ohio. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I can't live on myself anymore. I got you. I got you. So, okay. There's no doubt that she lived on steps and I can't grow up down with this. Tom, when did that move happen? Was it a dolly? You back. Step temper. Okay. No, I won't do a call from the back to the foreshare of temper. I can feel what I got half of it there. No, no, no, no, no. No, you're fine and Ohio. you're fine and Ohio, I'm fine, I'm fine. You can, okay, let us say, you know, give me a call back. Okay, and we could go from there and see what everything comes. Come, come, then. Say again. Do you want me to call you the second week of June? That's fine, that's long. All right. I see a lot of people in general, listen to what you're trying to face. They teach it out. That's it. On the third day, I'll do it all the time. It's fine. Okay. Okay, yeah, so let's take look at those first because, you know, if you've been taking those for a long time with your conditions, I might, my immediate recommendation, I like if you were my, you know, if you were my mom, I would tell you to keep the one that you have if you've been paying it for a long time. Because what they're going to do is they're going to put you on waiting periods for for getting new new policies, okay? So, well I'm a teacher once I got because I keep those on the day. I'm the day with like people like go up on the day. I'm a teacher, you have been there for a part of that day. Yeah. And you've been paying that part a long time. I've been for part of this is all my stuff. Oh, God. Yeah. That's all. That's great. I got more than four part of this is all myself. think about six. Yeah. I have a check there. And it's like, oh, yeah. See what they're here, coming out much. Because of just sitting here thinking about it, for four policies in the February 9th, that's my two-poomie, and two-poomagortia. And then I have a policy that's all this dollars the day just so many people and I'm about to see what I'm gonna do to shit. But I'm not the day guy because I think about my kids I don't want them to go on to nothing. You know, I love my children and I do not want to put them through all the I hear you. I told them, but let me clean it. Do not have the damn feeling and all that question you don't let shit. So they can have shit. Yeah, yeah, that's the way I'm going to do it too. Because it's all making a shit. My brother died and my mama had to pee. $500, but then I'm going to open the damn around when the package being paid up. Since she was a young guy, so my grandmother took about clocked out for all her children. And I'm like, this city's crazy. 500,000 just put a damn hole in the garage. It goes called me after the demo with the ground. That's what I mean, the same. So I told my children I was recreating. Don't worry about no damn. I'm feeling a little bit because you don't know why I'm not paying so much for that. That's the way I look at it. Yeah, I'm feeling my life all this time. They're getting better. I'm thinking about jump. Some people haven't told them. You only see where all that crap. Some people are not a bitch, but you're giggling all the way, you're paying for it. You're being really like a whole long time. I'm going to give you a call back during that second week of June, okay? Okay, I'm going to read my place. Yeah, to give you time to be settled in and then we'll look at the options for the IUL, okay? Okay. All right, all right. It's been a pleasure in that you take care. Sandy, darling. Bye-bye.
