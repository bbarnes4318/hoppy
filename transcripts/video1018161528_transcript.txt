=== FULL TRANSCRIPT WITH TIMESTAMPS ===

[00:00 - 00:14] You know, everybody here, the first thing that we're going to go over is the dialer information. So if you did not receive your dialer information, you're not going to be working tomorrow.
[00:14 - 00:23] We have either pending information or we received your information late or setting you up in a different payroll for a lot of the based in commission.
[00:23 - 00:38] We have payroll tracks with the hours that you're working. So it's a bit more complex. If you already received your login information, you're good to start tomorrow at 10 a.m.
[00:38 - 00:45] Hey, the user name and log. This is Frank. You probably know that the user name and login did not work.
[00:45 - 00:53] It's something something's in valid. Oh, all you're going to do is remove the space in between agent and 2025.
[00:53 - 01:06] Right. Yeah, it might work. I missed that. I saw the link. Minds is user name.
[01:06 - 01:10] Yeah, there is no space. So that's not the concern.
[01:10 - 01:20] It was when it was sent when it was sent to me. There was. Yeah, so you know, no problem. I tried it twice. I typed it in and cut and pasted it and they weren't either time.
[01:20 - 01:26] We're really trying to log in right now. And for anybody that has issues, let me know.
[01:26 - 01:31] They'll talk about that. But there's just racism checking this right now.
[01:31 - 01:41] I have a question for you, Nick, because I'm already loved and then I'm trying to like make sure that my connection and everything is okay.
[01:41 - 01:51] Just in case I maybe have to move to another room or something, you know, just to make sure things are right and there's no problems that I'm trying to call my own phone.
[01:51 - 01:57] And for some reason, it's not allowed me to call myself like I test my microphone, but that's not the issue.
[01:57 - 02:07] I want to hear it like on the phone. Yeah, I'm sorry. I just got to deal with. Yeah, it's not going to work.
[02:07 - 02:10] Just yeah. No. Yeah.
[02:10 - 02:12] Okay.
[02:12 - 02:17] Nick, I have the link. I just don't have a user name or password.
[02:17 - 02:22] I don't know if they were supposed to come to me in a in a private message.
[02:22 - 02:27] I just sent you information. I tried to do that to temporarily password.
[02:27 - 02:29] Um, to who was speaking.
[02:29 - 02:30] Mark.
[02:30 - 02:32] Okay.
[02:32 - 02:33] Okay.
[02:33 - 02:36] On here.
[02:36 - 02:40] Nick, if we're if we're going to the people who start on.
[02:40 - 02:42] Guys, guys, one by one.
[02:42 - 02:44] I got to deal with one by one.
[02:44 - 02:48] Okay. Yeah, everybody else was speaking. So I'm sorry. I thought it was okay.
[02:48 - 02:52] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I got to deal with one person by one person.
[02:52 - 02:56] Okay. So I'm talking. I'm going to talk now.
[02:56 - 03:04] Um, the people who are going to start Monday, such as me, which I don't mind because I'm too tired from working at my job.
[03:04 - 03:06] So I'll start Monday.
[03:06 - 03:11] Um, so how do I get my dollar and pay core?
[03:11 - 03:14] Third way from this. I got to talk up.
[03:14 - 03:15] I'm going to count.
[03:15 - 03:18] Margie, what is this?
[03:18 - 03:29] Um, I never received a user name and password.
[03:29 - 03:30] Unless I'm.
[03:30 - 03:32] My brand did it out.
[03:32 - 03:38] I figured I'd throw it in while you're writing it down.
[03:38 - 03:39] Everybody.
[03:39 - 03:40] Everybody.
[03:40 - 03:42] Have yourself muted.
[03:42 - 03:48] And also no banking information.
[03:48 - 03:52] I certainly mean yourself.
[03:52 - 04:01] Yeah, I sent you my pay core.
[04:01 - 04:07] And I got the, uh, the link for the engage cloud. Just know user name and password.
[04:07 - 04:16] And then I have a few scripting questions when we can get to that too.
[04:16 - 04:18] Yeah, everybody has a bunch of questions.
[04:18 - 04:20] Well, we're going to get to everybody's questions at the end of the meeting.
[04:20 - 04:22] I just want to go through a few things.
[04:22 - 04:24] Perfect. Thank you.
[04:24 - 04:31] No worries.
[04:31 - 04:32] Feel about it.
[04:32 - 04:37] Uh, I was in a Slack message.
[04:37 - 04:38] Yeah.
[04:38 - 04:39] Thanks.
[04:39 - 04:47] And then if that doesn't work, I sent you a backup temporary password.
[04:47 - 04:52] All right.
[04:52 - 04:53] Our next question.
[04:53 - 04:57] Are we in line?
[04:57 - 05:01] I don't want to speak out because people miss. Oh, she's speaking.
[05:01 - 05:02] Who's next?
[05:02 - 05:04] And then when can I be in the line?
[05:04 - 05:05] So.
[05:05 - 05:06] Yeah.
[05:06 - 05:09] All right.
[05:09 - 05:12] I'm going to have the good news.
[05:12 - 05:13] Monica, go ahead.
[05:13 - 05:19] Okay.
[05:19 - 05:20] Can you hear me?
[05:20 - 05:21] Yeah, I heard.
[05:21 - 05:22] Okay.
[05:22 - 05:23] Thank you.
[05:23 - 05:26] Uh, so I used the login.
[05:26 - 05:30] And it says 401 authorization required.
[05:30 - 05:34] Oh, I tried different.
[05:34 - 05:35] Yeah.
[05:35 - 05:36] Okay.
[05:36 - 05:38] Yeah, try different browser.
[05:38 - 05:40] Um, you may need to go.
[05:40 - 05:41] Okay.
[05:41 - 05:42] Okay.
[05:42 - 05:43] Okay.
[05:43 - 05:44] Thank you.
[05:44 - 05:45] Okay.
[05:45 - 05:46] Thank you.
[05:46 - 05:47] All right.
[05:47 - 05:54] So like I want to start on Monday anyway.
[05:54 - 05:59] And because, like I said, I was so overworked for my other job.
[05:59 - 06:03] So how can I get the links to start on Monday?
[06:03 - 06:04] The winners.
[06:04 - 06:05] It's nothing personal.
[06:05 - 06:06] Um,
[06:06 - 06:09] We just have contracting that's being done on the behalf of other people
[06:09 - 06:10] who are waiting for their.
[06:10 - 06:12] From their answer come through.
[06:12 - 06:13] So we have.
[06:13 - 06:14] Oh.
[06:14 - 06:15] Okay.
[06:15 - 06:17] So there's a possibility.
[06:17 - 06:18] I mean,
[06:18 - 06:19] I start on Monday.
[06:19 - 06:20] I had everything in.
[06:20 - 06:21] I thought.
[06:21 - 06:22] Um,
[06:22 - 06:23] No, we just don't have your.
[06:23 - 06:24] I don't know.
[06:24 - 06:25] I don't know.
[06:25 - 06:27] I don't know.
[06:27 - 06:28] I don't know.
[06:28 - 06:29] I don't know.
[06:29 - 06:30] I don't know.
[06:30 - 06:31] I don't know.
[06:31 - 06:32] I don't know.
[06:32 - 06:33] I don't know.
[06:33 - 06:34] I don't know.
[06:34 - 06:38] I don't know.
[06:38 - 06:39] I don't know.
[06:39 - 06:40] Um, no.
[06:40 - 06:44] No, we don't have your home state license.
[06:44 - 06:45] Really?
[06:45 - 06:46] Yeah.
[06:46 - 06:47] We don't have your home state.
[06:47 - 06:49] I'm looking at your right now.
[06:49 - 06:50] Yeah.
[06:50 - 06:53] Somebody we showed for a home state license.
[06:53 - 06:54] Um,
[06:54 - 06:56] and then your PDB.
[06:56 - 06:58] My wife.
[06:58 - 06:59] Your PDB report.
[06:59 - 07:01] So you're.
[07:01 - 07:03] Oh, I thought it was.
[07:03 - 07:07] Yeah, I kept asking if I had those things and you say,
[07:07 - 07:10] Oh, you're good, I thought I had a man.
[07:10 - 07:13] So what can I do now?
[07:13 - 07:15] How can I get those?
[07:15 - 07:16] Just add it to me.
[07:16 - 07:20] I'll try to let them know that you're on high priority
[07:20 - 07:22] because you want to start Monday.
[07:22 - 07:25] But even then, it's a lot of some of the agents
[07:25 - 07:27] were here about two, three weeks ago.
[07:27 - 07:29] So there's just a priority.
[07:29 - 07:31] Oh, I've been here a couple of weeks.
[07:31 - 07:34] I've been coming to the meetings every single night.
[07:34 - 07:36] Every night you would tell me I'm good.
[07:36 - 07:40] I've sent that PDP, you say it was good.
[07:40 - 07:44] And you said, you even told me today, Monday, you can start.
[07:44 - 07:47] And now you're telling me you don't have the things
[07:47 - 07:49] that are needed.
[07:49 - 07:52] I've been in the chat like every day.
[07:52 - 07:53] I know, Vanessa.
[07:53 - 07:58] Vanessa, you joined the 21st of October.
[07:58 - 08:00] It's what we're doing, everything in our power.
[08:00 - 08:01] So you guys are on board it.
[08:01 - 08:04] We want to get to work and trust us.
[08:04 - 08:08] I'm just, like I mentioned, that there's a lot of parts.
[08:08 - 08:11] I'm pushing for you to start asking as possible.
[08:11 - 08:14] As soon as you raise my hand, it goes down.
[08:14 - 08:19] So I'll be posted and I'll let you know.
[08:19 - 08:25] Yeah, because I mean, it should be the third and the number.
[08:25 - 08:25] Sorry.
[08:25 - 08:32] I'm ready by accident, Vanessa.
[08:32 - 08:35] Little to talk to anybody who thinks they sent in their state
[08:35 - 08:38] license, but you think they didn't.
[08:38 - 08:41] I was sending mine as the PDF.
[08:41 - 08:44] And it needs the last four of your social code to log in.
[08:44 - 08:47] I had to change it and copy and paste it
[08:47 - 08:55] into like a word document for you to be able to see it.
[08:55 - 08:56] Yes, thank you.
[08:56 - 08:57] Vanessa, go ahead.
[08:57 - 09:02] I didn't mean to meet you.
[09:02 - 09:04] OK, can you hear me?
[09:04 - 09:05] Yeah, and I heard it.
[09:05 - 09:08] Yeah, so I'm very stressed out.
[09:08 - 09:13] And I had the principal of the school called me
[09:13 - 09:15] and told me to come help because people
[09:15 - 09:17] were stranded in Jamaica, some teachers.
[09:17 - 09:20] So I didn't help children.
[09:20 - 09:22] And so I'm a hard working person.
[09:22 - 09:23] I used to be a school teacher.
[09:23 - 09:27] And I just was, you know, temporarily helping there.
[09:27 - 09:31] So I said, no, I have another job to go to now.
[09:31 - 09:34] So I mean, I don't want to be without a job.
[09:34 - 09:38] I took this because I wanted a job in a full-time job
[09:38 - 09:39] for until January.
[09:39 - 09:45] So, you know, I don't know what to do now.
[09:45 - 09:48] Vanessa, do you tell me, at the last minute,
[09:48 - 09:51] you don't have my state, you don't have this in there.
[09:51 - 09:55] And I've been asking like every day.
[09:55 - 09:58] And I mean, I'm from Louisiana, but I'm not ignorant.
[09:58 - 10:01] I have worked insurance for years,
[10:01 - 10:03] and I used to be a school teacher.
[10:03 - 10:04] My daughter is a doctor.
[10:04 - 10:05] I have a daughter as an accountant.
[10:05 - 10:09] We are intelligent people.
[10:09 - 10:10] Vanessa, I'm with you.
[10:10 - 10:11] I'm not against you.
[10:11 - 10:12] I'm trying to help you out.
[10:12 - 10:13] There's a lot of moving parts.
[10:13 - 10:15] It's not up to me to get you on boarded.
[10:15 - 10:17] There's people in the back and then you
[10:17 - 10:21] need to get to properly set up through healthcare.gov.
[10:21 - 10:25] So you can receive the phone calls.
[10:25 - 10:28] It's not, we're doing everything out of power, Vanessa.
[10:28 - 10:32] So, if it's not the third, it will be the time.
[10:32 - 10:34] But we'll keep you posted.
[10:34 - 10:38] OK, when can I get with you to see when I can start working?
[10:38 - 10:41] Because I guess I just don't need to be in this meeting.
[10:41 - 10:45] I've been, I mean, I've worked with autistic children,
[10:45 - 10:47] so on time.
[10:47 - 10:51] OK, Vanessa, just in your stand, and it's a pleasure.
[10:51 - 10:53] Everybody, if you're on base plus commission,
[10:53 - 10:57] you're on a different payroll as a person that would be just
[10:57 - 10:58] on commission.
[10:58 - 11:00] If you wanted to start working immediately,
[11:00 - 11:03] I could get you on working pretty quickly
[11:03 - 11:04] through the commission payroll.
[11:04 - 11:07] But if you, since we're setting you up on base plus commission,
[11:07 - 11:11] the payroll takes track of the hours
[11:11 - 11:13] that you're on the dialet.
[11:13 - 11:14] Does that make sense?
[11:14 - 11:18] So, it's a bit more complex than you wish to do base plus commission.
[11:18 - 11:23] There's more moving cars to it than behind the scenes.
[11:23 - 11:25] Yeah, I was starting on Monday to do the base plus commission.
[11:25 - 11:27] Like, if you're not able to start,
[11:27 - 11:30] like, this Monday would have to be another Monday, or I didn't know of that.
[11:30 - 11:32] You mentioned the third or the tenth, right?
[11:32 - 11:34] I didn't know if that would be a difference.
[11:34 - 11:35] I'm sorry, for out of respect for Vanessa.
[11:35 - 11:38] I just want to answer the question.
[11:38 - 11:44] So, Vanessa, if it is something that you need to resolve
[11:44 - 11:48] urgently, I recommend I could get anybody here on the dialer.
[11:48 - 11:51] They wish to be on commission just because of the payroll works
[11:51 - 11:53] to an immediate fix.
[11:53 - 11:56] If not, you may have to wait until Monday for the new arrangements.
[11:56 - 12:01] Yeah, I didn't want to work tomorrow anyway, to be honest.
[12:01 - 12:03] Like I said, I'm stressed out from work.
[12:03 - 12:07] So, trying to help them people, those children,
[12:07 - 12:08] they're stressed out.
[12:08 - 12:12] They say they don't have a teacher, you know.
[12:12 - 12:13] Yeah, so what do you worry about?
[12:13 - 12:14] We're in the same page, then.
[12:14 - 12:15] You're going to...
[12:15 - 12:16] Okay.
[12:16 - 12:17] Yeah.
[12:17 - 12:18] All right.
[12:18 - 12:19] All right.
[12:19 - 12:26] Joe, Joe, let's go ahead.
[12:26 - 12:30] I can't raise my hand to just let me know when I can jump in.
[12:30 - 12:32] Hey, I'm sorry about that.
[12:32 - 12:34] I didn't see Joe F. I'm sorry.
[12:34 - 12:35] I forgot.
[12:35 - 12:37] You know, I was just thinking about my name.
[12:37 - 12:39] I'm sorry about that.
[12:39 - 12:45] So, we're good from Monday on the base plus commission.
[12:45 - 12:51] You should be as long as you submitted all the paperwork
[12:51 - 12:53] and not this far away.
[12:53 - 12:54] All right.
[12:54 - 12:56] But how about me?
[12:56 - 13:01] You got my paperwork, you got it online on your email.
[13:01 - 13:04] And you asked me to resubmit inside of your...
[13:04 - 13:07] Inside of Slack, right?
[13:07 - 13:12] But you had my information for some time.
[13:12 - 13:14] So, am I good?
[13:14 - 13:15] Or what's my situation?
[13:15 - 13:16] Yeah.
[13:16 - 13:17] Again, there's a lot of moving parts.
[13:17 - 13:19] So, if you're on base plus commission, we're anticipating
[13:19 - 13:21] that you should be starting Monday.
[13:21 - 13:24] We're doing everything on our part for you to start Monday.
[13:24 - 13:31] First case scenario, as we said to regions about two weeks, a week ago.
[13:31 - 13:36] For anybody that's submitting paperwork this week,
[13:36 - 13:39] which anticipates the start to 10th of November,
[13:39 - 13:42] but we're pushing everything to get you started this Monday.
[13:42 - 13:43] No, I totally got you.
[13:43 - 13:48] See, my thing is that my paperwork wasn't submitted this week.
[13:48 - 13:51] My paperwork was submitted, but it was submitted by email.
[13:51 - 13:52] Right?
[13:52 - 13:54] I submitted it to you by email, Nicholas.
[13:54 - 13:55] So, I'm wondering...
[13:55 - 13:59] It's not a matter of...
[13:59 - 14:02] of being the proper thing or whatnot.
[14:02 - 14:06] It has to go through a few people for them to approve.
[14:06 - 14:07] No, I totally get it.
[14:07 - 14:08] I totally get it.
[14:08 - 14:10] I'm just trying to pull all transparency.
[14:10 - 14:12] I'm just trying to figure it out.
[14:12 - 14:13] Right?
[14:13 - 14:18] Now, let's say that I came on and I came on on a basis of commission.
[14:18 - 14:24] Can I switch over immediately when...
[14:24 - 14:27] You know what I mean?
[14:27 - 14:30] You know, I went to the commission.
[14:30 - 14:32] I went from...
[14:32 - 14:35] Oh, sorry.
[14:35 - 14:37] I muted your last accident.
[14:37 - 14:39] I mentioned something else.
[14:39 - 14:40] I'm sorry.
[14:40 - 14:44] I went from to a commission standpoint.
[14:44 - 14:45] Right?
[14:46 - 14:47] For...
[14:47 - 14:50] I mean, the base plus commission, I was...
[14:50 - 14:51] I was like, okay, let me...
[14:51 - 14:52] Let me give it a shot.
[14:52 - 14:54] You know, I'm not going to have Anne better.
[14:54 - 14:57] I'm not going to have, you know, UAC.
[14:57 - 15:00] Let me see what it's like and let me see what the script is like.
[15:00 - 15:01] Let me see...
[15:01 - 15:07] Because I've never sold on a healthcare.gov platform.
[15:07 - 15:08] Right?
[15:08 - 15:10] So, I don't know...
[15:10 - 15:13] I don't know, like, you know,
[15:13 - 15:16] like, commission sales could be the roof.
[15:16 - 15:18] You know what I mean?
[15:18 - 15:22] I just wanted to put my foot in the water before I went to straight commission.
[15:22 - 15:23] You know?
[15:23 - 15:24] You know, within the first hour,
[15:24 - 15:25] it's worth it or not,
[15:25 - 15:27] because you make sales within the first hour.
[15:27 - 15:31] So, it's a quick sales cycle.
[15:31 - 15:34] So, you'll know if you're good within the first hour.
[15:34 - 15:35] But...
[15:35 - 15:40] But I was really looking for a base plus commission thing, you know,
[15:40 - 15:42] and that was very attractive.
[15:42 - 15:44] You know, you can still do it.
[15:44 - 15:45] It's going to take a...
[15:45 - 15:48] It's just going to anticipate that you may have to start this Monday
[15:48 - 15:50] or we're spacing out at 1.1.
[15:50 - 15:51] Okay.
[15:51 - 15:55] Now, if I was starting on commission, right,
[15:55 - 15:59] could I just move straight to base plus commission?
[15:59 - 16:03] Is that something that I can do?
[16:03 - 16:04] No.
[16:04 - 16:05] You see, so...
[16:05 - 16:06] See, that's...
[16:06 - 16:08] That's what puts me in a corner.
[16:08 - 16:10] So, listen, there's nothing personal here.
[16:10 - 16:11] It's all business.
[16:11 - 16:14] I just understand that you've been more than kind.
[16:14 - 16:15] Right?
[16:15 - 16:19] So, I'm just trying to move with you how you need me to move.
[16:19 - 16:24] But the base plus commission was a thing for me, you know,
[16:24 - 16:27] because I don't have like certain carriers.
[16:27 - 16:28] I'm blocky.
[16:28 - 16:30] You see that I was O'Neill.
[16:30 - 16:31] You know what I mean?
[16:31 - 16:34] So, you know, I'm kind of blocked off.
[16:34 - 16:37] Yeah, that's why you're right.
[16:37 - 16:42] I mean, however you was.
[16:42 - 16:43] We'll go ahead.
[16:43 - 16:48] We'll...
[16:48 - 16:51] Yeah, can you hear me?
[16:51 - 16:52] Yes.
[16:52 - 16:53] Yeah.
[16:53 - 16:58] So, I got confused on when you said that the reason,
[16:58 - 17:02] why that is the ones that says base...
[17:02 - 17:06] The ones that wants to do base plus commission start on Monday.
[17:06 - 17:10] And if you want to go quicker, you have to start in commissions.
[17:10 - 17:12] If you want to do a Saturday,
[17:12 - 17:16] you said that the reason why it's like that is because of the pay structure.
[17:16 - 17:19] I'm kind of confused on that.
[17:19 - 17:21] Because you said that the...
[17:21 - 17:22] The technicality.
[17:22 - 17:23] It's the dialer.
[17:23 - 17:24] It's the dialer.
[17:24 - 17:25] Yeah, it's the dialer.
[17:25 - 17:26] The dialer.
[17:26 - 17:27] So, there's two payrolls.
[17:27 - 17:29] There's payroll for people that work on commission.
[17:29 - 17:32] And there's payroll for people that work on a base plus commission.
[17:32 - 17:34] Since we're going to be paying you a...
[17:34 - 17:36] For the people that want to do base plus commission,
[17:36 - 17:39] we have to track the amount of hours that you guys are going to be working.
[17:39 - 17:40] And we do the dialer.
[17:40 - 17:42] And you can't check the hours on...
[17:42 - 17:43] You can't do...
[17:43 - 17:45] You can't check the hours if we start on Saturday.
[17:45 - 17:48] Because the dialer is still going to be used.
[17:48 - 17:50] So, that's one of the things.
[17:50 - 17:53] It's something in the back and it takes longer to process.
[17:53 - 17:55] There's a lot of moving parts.
[17:55 - 17:56] I mean, we're doing every...
[17:56 - 17:57] Trust me.
[17:57 - 17:59] If we could, we would.
[17:59 - 18:01] We're pushing everything that we can.
[18:01 - 18:02] We're speaking to admins.
[18:02 - 18:07] We're pushing forward base plus commission people.
[18:07 - 18:11] I mean, I've always mentioned it.
[18:11 - 18:14] That it...
[18:14 - 18:16] If you're coming on new,
[18:16 - 18:17] bear with us.
[18:17 - 18:18] We're going to do everything in our power.
[18:18 - 18:20] So, you guys are starting as soon as possible.
[18:20 - 18:21] You just have to be a bit...
[18:21 - 18:22] Oh!
[18:22 - 18:24] If you want to do base plus commission,
[18:24 - 18:25] it's just a two-day difference.
[18:25 - 18:27] Of course, case scenario 10th of November.
[18:27 - 18:29] I don't anticipate it going there.
[18:29 - 18:31] I'm doing everything in my power.
[18:31 - 18:33] I stayed here 18 hours.
[18:33 - 18:35] So, I'm really trying to do everything in my power here.
[18:35 - 18:37] So, it's nothing personal.
[18:37 - 18:39] There's just a lot of contingencies.
[18:39 - 18:40] All right.
[18:40 - 18:41] And I do...
[18:41 - 18:43] I'll move forward here.
[18:43 - 18:44] Because there's a lot of hands.
[18:44 - 18:45] Can you buy...
[18:45 - 18:46] Okay.
[18:46 - 18:50] Can you see my report real quick?
[18:50 - 19:12] We were steamed all your paperwork
[19:12 - 19:17] by the 25th of October.
[19:17 - 19:20] We were steamed your driver's license
[19:20 - 19:23] from the Saturday, 25th of October.
[19:23 - 19:28] And it was posted to our box rubbed
[19:28 - 19:31] with some really information.
[19:31 - 19:34] So, the process, the 26th,
[19:34 - 19:36] we're just pending on that.
[19:36 - 19:38] We're just pending on your...
[19:38 - 19:42] your approval in your dialed information.
[19:42 - 19:43] All right.
[19:43 - 19:44] No problem.
[19:44 - 19:47] So, I just have to wait for my paid court and dialer, correct?
[19:47 - 19:50] If you want to do the base plus commission, yeah.
[19:50 - 19:53] If you want to do the commission,
[19:53 - 20:02] that's probably going to be a bit faster, yeah.
[20:02 - 20:03] All right.
[20:03 - 20:05] Sure.
[20:05 - 20:06] Let's go.
[20:06 - 20:07] All right.
[20:07 - 20:08] Thank you.
[20:08 - 20:09] All right.
[20:09 - 20:11] My question's kind of pretty brief.
[20:11 - 20:15] I just kind of want to know with our carrier selection,
[20:15 - 20:17] kind of just being very tight.
[20:17 - 20:20] Do you expect that there would be any kind of hindrance
[20:20 - 20:22] to the amount of enrollments we would make
[20:22 - 20:24] based on the carrier selection that we have?
[20:24 - 20:26] Or do you think it's same as last year
[20:26 - 20:28] we should be able to rip and run?
[20:28 - 20:29] Same as last year.
[20:29 - 20:30] Blue Cross Rouge Field is going to be offered
[20:30 - 20:32] with in all zip codes.
[20:32 - 20:36] It's the most favorite carrier by anybody.
[20:36 - 20:37] Everybody likes Blue Cross Rouge Field
[20:37 - 20:39] and it's offered in all zip codes.
[20:39 - 20:40] Awesome.
[20:40 - 20:45] Only thing is we're going to be South Carolina.
[20:45 - 20:48] But you're not going to get, yeah,
[20:48 - 20:51] besides that, most of them are Blue Cross Rouge.
[20:51 - 20:53] So, it shouldn't be part of that.
[20:53 - 20:55] Thank you, Nick.
[20:55 - 21:03] Let me go with Miss Chapman.
[21:03 - 21:06] Yeah, super quick.
[21:06 - 21:10] I was wondering, are you going over your script this evening, Nick?
[21:10 - 21:11] At all.
[21:11 - 21:13] Were you speaking to that or just buttoning up
[21:13 - 21:15] everything else with onboarding?
[21:15 - 21:16] onboarding.
[21:16 - 21:17] I can read.
[21:17 - 21:20] I can send you out the script.
[21:20 - 21:24] I posted the training with the script.
[21:24 - 21:25] No, you're personal.
[21:25 - 21:26] You're slow.
[21:26 - 21:27] Yours.
[21:27 - 21:28] Do you have a recording?
[21:28 - 21:31] We're going to need record recordings or?
[21:31 - 21:32] We do.
[21:32 - 21:33] Yeah.
[21:33 - 21:34] On the cloud.
[21:34 - 21:35] This black enough.
[21:35 - 21:37] You have the script itself, correct?
[21:37 - 21:38] Yes.
[21:38 - 21:39] Yes, sir.
[21:39 - 21:40] I have that.
[21:40 - 21:42] I just wanted to hear your flow.
[21:42 - 21:45] At the end, at the end, everything's recorded.
[21:45 - 21:48] At the end, I'm going to go over a hell strip of enrollment
[21:48 - 21:49] for the last time.
[21:49 - 21:50] Okay.
[21:50 - 21:51] Okay.
[21:51 - 21:52] And the last time.
[21:52 - 21:53] Okay.
[21:53 - 21:55] Thank you.
[21:55 - 21:56] The team.
[21:56 - 21:58] Go ahead.
[21:58 - 21:59] Yeah.
[21:59 - 22:01] How long is this meeting?
[22:01 - 22:03] Is this going to be like another Q&A?
[22:03 - 22:10] Because I was under the impression that this was really mandatory for the people who are really starting tomorrow.
[22:10 - 22:13] And this was really like important.
[22:13 - 22:18] So, just respect to anybody like who was on here asking questions.
[22:18 - 22:23] However, like, I just need to get the information because it is late.
[22:23 - 22:26] You know, these meetings are really late.
[22:26 - 22:30] And if it was information that he needed to go over, I would really appreciate it.
[22:30 - 22:35] If we really keep it short and like let him get everything, he needs to get out.
[22:35 - 22:39] And then write your questions down, put them in a chat or whatever.
[22:39 - 22:41] Save it to the end.
[22:41 - 22:43] Because it's so many of us.
[22:43 - 22:47] And then some of us like, you know, you're not the only ones here.
[22:47 - 22:51] And we got to like really, like be mindful of that.
[22:51 - 22:53] So that's what I need to know.
[22:53 - 22:56] Like, how much longer do I need to be on this call?
[22:56 - 22:58] Because I start in the morning.
[22:58 - 23:02] So I need to get whatever information that you needed for me to get.
[23:02 - 23:03] You got it.
[23:03 - 23:05] And so you received your dialer.
[23:05 - 23:07] Were you able to log into your dialer?
[23:07 - 23:14] No, except for that thing that I told you about earlier, where I've trying to, you know, call out to my phone.
[23:14 - 23:16] And try to see how it sounds.
[23:16 - 23:17] I couldn't do it.
[23:17 - 23:20] But other than that, it was successful.
[23:20 - 23:22] Yeah. You should be good tomorrow morning.
[23:22 - 23:25] As long as you got the dialer, you're in a whole Sherpa.
[23:25 - 23:27] You know how to work the end pinover ride sheet.
[23:27 - 23:30] There's no reason for you to stay.
[23:30 - 23:35] If you have all that, I'm just tracking that everybody's good to go tomorrow.
[23:35 - 23:37] So we're verifying.
[23:37 - 23:41] If you know how to work, just have.
[23:41 - 23:42] Yeah, yeah.
[23:42 - 23:44] I'm not new to ACA.
[23:44 - 23:45] I'm pretty familiar.
[23:45 - 23:47] So I'm going to be right.
[23:47 - 23:49] But like a question.
[23:49 - 23:51] I'm still speaking.
[23:51 - 23:53] But yeah, that's all I needed to know.
[23:53 - 23:54] Thank you.
[23:54 - 23:55] No worries.
[23:55 - 23:58] Vicki, go ahead.
[23:58 - 24:06] Yeah, I cannot get into my dialer.
[24:06 - 24:09] What does it say when you try to?
[24:09 - 24:10] Yeah.
[24:10 - 24:11] I get it.
[24:11 - 24:15] Okay.
[24:15 - 24:19] It's invalid input in correct user name or password.
[24:19 - 24:28] Maybe the temporary password.
[24:28 - 24:32] Yes.
[24:32 - 24:33] That's your slot for this.
[24:33 - 24:34] Wait, hold on.
[24:34 - 24:35] I've had a deal with this.
[24:35 - 24:38] I was on the phone all day with the marketplace about this.
[24:38 - 24:44] This is like a big thing that's happening is it for integrating and new health Sherpa account.
[24:44 - 24:45] Second matter.
[24:45 - 24:52] I just sent you your.
[24:55 - 24:56] Okay.
[24:56 - 24:57] Let me check it out.
[24:57 - 24:58] It's going to be.
[24:58 - 24:59] Yeah.
[24:59 - 25:00] Try that password.
[25:00 - 25:02] If that helps.
[25:02 - 25:03] Oh, yeah.
[25:03 - 25:04] I see that.
[25:04 - 25:05] Okay.
[25:05 - 25:06] Thank you.
[25:06 - 25:07] Let me know what that was.
[25:07 - 25:08] One moment here.
[25:08 - 25:21] Hey, Nick.
[25:21 - 25:22] Can I make one quick statement?
[25:22 - 25:24] And then I can probably get off here.
[25:24 - 25:26] This is Frank Francis.
[25:26 - 25:28] Yeah.
[25:28 - 25:30] All right.
[25:30 - 25:32] So what you're with this.
[25:32 - 25:33] Ambient override sheet.
[25:33 - 25:38] That's just basically we need to use the those agents information.
[25:38 - 25:41] What we're saying goes carries in those states, right?
[25:41 - 25:46] That's that's how we're when we when we do the application on Sherpa.
[25:46 - 25:47] Yes.
[25:47 - 25:49] You'll see an NP override option.
[25:49 - 25:54] You're going to have to write under these agents within these characters.
[25:54 - 25:55] Yes.
[25:55 - 25:56] All right.
[25:56 - 25:57] So perfect.
[25:57 - 25:58] So I think I'm good to go.
[25:58 - 25:59] You were great.
[25:59 - 26:00] Nick.
[26:00 - 26:01] Yes.
[26:01 - 26:02] You've been putting many hours in.
[26:02 - 26:04] You were slacking last night at three, three, forty or something like that.
[26:04 - 26:05] So yes, Nick.
[26:05 - 26:06] You were great.
[26:06 - 26:07] I appreciate it.
[26:07 - 26:08] Fair for.
[26:08 - 26:09] You may have Nick.

[26:25 - 26:29] I was able to get in as well.
[26:29 - 26:30] Using firefox.
[26:30 - 26:31] So thank you.
[26:31 - 26:32] Firefox.
[26:32 - 26:33] Yes.
[26:33 - 26:34] Yeah.
[26:34 - 26:36] Richard Hale says they can't get in.
[26:36 - 26:37] Richard Hale.
[26:37 - 26:38] What is.
[26:38 - 26:49] I'm still getting the 401 authorization required I tried both chrome and edge both I don't
[26:49 - 26:54] have Firefox on my computer I guess I can download it yeah I tried to download it because
[26:54 - 26:59] I have it too I go and you know I'm not it doesn't work Firefox has been my only solution
[26:59 - 27:08] okay I'll download it now okay Nick everything's working for me Nick some I'm gonna go ahead
[27:08 - 27:15] and jump out here okay all right all right thank you sir I think I'm all set as well
[27:15 - 27:21] I've got the npn over edge sheet I'll log in and health syrup already to go so I will
[27:21 - 27:26] see you tomorrow Nick perfect the scripting questions I have I think everybody's gonna
[27:26 - 27:30] have once they get into it though so that's why I wanted to ask those before people started
[27:30 - 27:39] hopping off what scripting questions for example in the income qualification wouldn't it
[27:39 - 27:50] be your 2026 best guess oh for the projected annual income yeah it would be their 2025
[27:50 - 27:54] best guess because what they're gonna file for the it's they're gonna file taxes in the
[27:54 - 28:04] year of 2026 for their 2025 taxes right but we're selling them 2026 insurance so
[28:04 - 28:11] since that year they're guessing the income for because all this year I was asking 2025
[28:11 - 28:19] best guess income yeah I just asked them for the year because when they filed their taxes so 2026
[28:19 - 28:25] of April you're gonna file your taxes for the year of 2025 yeah but that's what applies to
[28:25 - 28:37] your 2025 ACA insurance no yeah you're thinking it so it would be this year what it was to
[28:37 - 28:43] protect that income for this year for because April you're gonna file for the past year's
[28:43 - 28:50] income statement yeah all right I'll say 2025 if you want but I don't think that's right but also
[28:50 - 28:57] at verifications we need the correct email address to give them it gives some funky company that
[28:59 - 29:06] and we need a customer service number to give them at the referral section yeah did you receive
[29:07 - 29:15] a we're in the meeting where where they sent out all the the actual shared document or the description
[29:21 - 29:27] sorry I muted you by accident meant to meet somebody else guys if you're talking just
[29:27 - 29:37] to talk over go ahead I'm sorry miss I lost you I muted you by accident I was trying to meet some
[29:38 - 29:45] oh sorry yeah so when I look at that but at least last time I looked at that live script it still
[29:45 - 29:49] had no phone number for the customer service number that we're supposed to give them in the
[29:49 - 29:59] referral section and it had still the wrong email to give them to in the verifications where it says
[29:59 - 30:07] you know to cancel this email us at it had some other company in there will send me your email
[30:07 - 30:14] address or we sent out a live document kind of like a Google Street where you can see any changes
[30:14 - 30:20] made because the other is the fewest but we modified it to ensure documents so I can send it over to you
[30:20 - 30:29] if you have a email I just want to see if anybody could hear me because they hadn't
[30:29 - 30:34] up any able to talk this entire meeting yeah you got to raise your hand I'm going on by
[30:34 - 30:39] no I can't raise my hand that's what I've been trying to say yeah I can't I don't have a hand
[30:39 - 30:47] raised thing either today sorry that's why I've been hopping and then the objections link on
[30:47 - 30:53] that live document was dead not that I care about if anybody needed it and then I don't know if
[30:53 - 30:57] we're setting up voicemails and stuff and that contact card in the dialer oh yeah I wouldn't

[45:27 - 45:32] oh yeah it's barely starting to get a little cool barely this week
[45:34 - 45:40] i know that i have a lot of bugs there it gets humid um all right and miss do i have your
[45:40 - 45:48] consent to check the marketplace you've got information and your health options yes perfect so once
[45:48 - 45:55] i get consent and she has to say yes um click this check mark and then you have access just
[45:55 - 46:08] to some place you're asking the first piece of the information of consent which marketplace
[46:08 - 46:31] your application and follow along with the script miss as a right now do you felt uh
[46:31 - 46:47] taxes single or married married okay no worries and two two of the guys who haven't worked with
[46:47 - 46:53] called Sherpa are you're gonna want to click on both both of these buttons scroll down click on
[46:53 - 46:58] store consent outside of all Sherpa but we have consent to record it calls guys are asking consent
[46:58 - 47:05] twice read the call we'll met the beginning of call and at the closing of the call so we'll
[47:05 - 47:13] follow with the script um perfect okay and miss uh in order just to understand to qualify for
[47:13 - 47:22] subsidies if you are married you must join uh you must follow your taxes stop now did you want
[47:22 - 47:28] to include your your spouse or one of your children onto the policy to see if you do qualify for
[47:28 - 47:41] subsidies yeah okay that would be great first now let me have them here and miss i just
[47:41 - 47:49] need to double check you did follow your taxes for the year 2023 and 2020 correct yes perfect
[47:54 - 48:01] and miss as best as you can what would you say your projected household income is for the year 2025
[48:03 - 48:19] um for this year uh for 2025 yeah um it's gonna be uh it'll be uh 21,000
[48:20 - 48:30] around 21,000 will come no worries um so just so you understand um out around that income bracket
[48:30 - 48:37] i can get to subsidies independently um if you were to file your taxes independently um if we were to
[48:37 - 48:42] include somebody else within the household uh you wouldn't qualify for any subsidies they would
[48:42 - 48:46] more than likely just tell you to reach out to Medicaid directly which would be
[48:46 - 48:51] hyperocratic you'd have to reach out to them or if i actually be approved for Medicaid
[48:52 - 49:00] um now what i can do is i can see if we can get you approved for a policy independently and if it's
[49:00 - 49:07] that good fit um it may be more affordable would that be something that um that you're open to miss
[49:08 - 49:15] well what if my husband also has an income oh yeah well what would you say the projected
[49:15 - 49:23] income is of the household yeah so it would be about uh 51,000
[49:25 - 49:29] 51,000 okay and uh between you and your husband do you guys have any children
[49:31 - 49:38] yes oh yeah two girls and with any policy did you want to include them as well
[49:39 - 49:46] yes okay of course no worries so long for both your husband and your two children here
[49:49 - 49:55] um again guys just so you understand the more people that you bring on to a health insurance plan
[49:55 - 49:59] the better compensation you're getting you're not getting paid for application you're getting paid
[49:59 - 50:12] per person um so bear that in mind and um i'm going to come to this social at the end but i'm
[50:12 - 50:17] following the script um as of right now miss what are you currently looking for in a health insurance
[50:17 - 50:21] policy where you're looking to find a doctor with a network or you're looking to get sort of
[50:21 - 50:28] medications covered what's got you're looking for health insurance yeah uh medication covered
[50:28 - 50:40] and just make sure my doctor's cover yeah i know worries um what what is your what are the
[50:40 - 50:50] medications you're currently taking miss um and take um uh glipa side
[50:50 - 51:11] glipa side anything else besides that um and uh met foreman and i know you want to
[51:11 - 51:16] and you probably have a intention of continuing seeing the same doctor correct you know when
[51:16 - 51:21] to change out doctor yes right perfect so let's find the all those two that your doctor's going to
[51:21 - 51:35] say uh what is the name of that doctor um see like um you can say i ran them like hospital or something
[51:35 - 51:42] oh my doctor's the ex-wife hospital just a doctor speaker i'm trying to put it like if someone had
[51:42 - 51:48] diabetes like all of this none of this applies to me but this is not my info but i'm just trying to
[51:48 - 51:59] make it to just like if i had one that had diabetes like um doctor speaker sp a k e r she's just
[51:59 - 52:11] a pcp but okay um no worries so i i would have like a no pad here and i would just write down all
[52:11 - 52:18] that information so i can run us yeah okay and okay guys i'm just doing this so you guys can see um
[52:18 - 52:25] okay uh no worries miss what i'm gonna do now is i'm just gonna put you in a brief hold um and i'm
[52:25 - 52:31] gonna see what options you are eligible for that your doctors would take as well as
[52:31 - 52:42] uh risky colors for your medications okay okay so realistically i would have everything written
[52:42 - 52:47] down in you know no pad um i would have a no pads where you write all their information that way
[52:47 - 53:04] you don't have to ask a whole times um everybody has a different way of doing things here i pulled up all
[53:04 - 53:12] the information um and miss uh just to add your husband to the pulse to what is your husband's
[53:12 - 53:28] fit of birth it's May 13th 1967 and your children's fit of birth as well
[53:29 - 53:44] okay um march 15th um 1999 and your other third child's fit of birth
[53:45 - 53:54] October 12th 2002 2002 oh it was it's birthday recently happy birthday 10
[53:57 - 54:02] thank you no worries and you said the projected income of the household was around 55,000 correct
[54:03 - 54:16] yeah with me and my husband was angry could you repeat the zip code one more time
[54:17 - 54:31] seven six one three seven so her income right here her income is too low or a family of four they're
[54:31 - 54:38] gonna want to take her to Medicaid um so what i would do is i would pose out um options to include her
[54:38 - 54:47] kids and see if she would be granted a stuff study for both her and her husband but i actually
[54:47 - 54:56] just maybe just because so what if the the child works so does that count uh yeah if they're
[54:56 - 55:00] under 26 and they want to be in a family plan yeah and you can also add them their income
[55:00 - 55:07] well they have to be under 26 that's the path for for somebody to receive insurance okay because she
[55:07 - 55:16] is 26 oh okay yeah so she's 26 they're gonna clap they're not gonna be able to get out her
[55:17 - 55:27] they're what if if she's 26 he's not gonna be able to get on a family plan 26 is like the cut-off
[55:27 - 55:43] so 25 yeah good so put um you know put children 14 times just a four just a good idea
[55:52 - 55:57] so we could just put like one like if i had just one child
[55:57 - 56:07] yeah i mean it's it's they're with uh with a big beautiful bill they kind of change
[56:07 - 56:16] a few things with yeah yeah what have the subsidies work i was just trying to make it easier for
[56:16 - 56:26] you know just no i appreciate that um what are some of the things that they change with that big
[56:26 - 56:34] beautiful bill um the how many how much subsidy is a percent diversity so okay i just put the
[56:34 - 56:39] i just forgot to put the household members that's what it can't do okay i'm sick
[56:44 - 57:12] 14 but let's say instead 55,000 1976 was your date of birth is what you said and then how
[57:12 - 57:29] did you say your husband was miss made 13th 1967 so yeah even with the 55,000 dollar income
[57:30 - 57:35] you'd see that's the qualifies for fully subsidized plan um now what i would want you guys to do
[57:35 - 57:40] is to see okay so you found all the options here that you want to get ideally a policy that's
[57:40 - 57:45] gonna be zero dollars premium that way you don't have to ask for any card credit card or bank
[57:45 - 57:57] accounting for mason it's kind of easy your sale um it's an order taking um and then pull up
[57:58 - 58:14] and pin override you're going to go factor and pin override and you're going to want to find a
[58:14 - 58:22] policy within the state of taxes that is that is your being offered so you'll see blue cross
[58:22 - 58:31] bridge field great policy you guys can enroll in blue cross bridge fields um other blue cross
[58:31 - 58:38] bridge fields ideally you want the blue cross bridge field with the lowest deductible um you can
[58:38 - 58:44] also click on the blue cross bridge field taxes here to aim it out um but she also mentioned to
[58:44 - 58:49] me that she's taking some medications you know if she's very worried about maybe she's taking
[58:49 - 58:57] out expensive medications such as insulin um you can type in insulin and make sure that whatever
[58:57 - 59:05] policy you get is going to cover it also add done click on this little tab and it'll tell you
[59:06 - 59:12] a insulin's covering it so with the blue cross plan that we sell uh $900 or like a thousand
[59:12 - 59:20] $200 medication would be covered it would only cost you $25 which is phenomenal um and then also
[59:20 - 59:29] for example let's say Jennifer Lynn is her Jennifer speaker is the name of her medic we just go
[59:29 - 01:00:04] here click on add doctor total doctor Jennifer speaker hold up speaker but you'll see pop-ups
[01:00:04 - 01:00:16] of all the doctors here do you have to put dr first or you can put in their first name yeah it's
[01:00:17 - 01:00:24] some some have doctors some don't some have it but it's best it's probably best if you type in
[01:00:24 - 01:00:30] their full name if you know their full name um so let's say it's doctor mark speaker you click add
[01:00:30 - 01:00:40] click done and you would select this option this option you want to find a policy that'll cover
[01:00:40 - 01:00:45] both the doctor and the medications there's not too many options but if you want to
[01:00:45 - 01:00:51] if she's not taking medications here let's do with doctors going to take it it's like it's a
[01:00:51 - 01:01:00] picky doctor I'm not sure um this doctor is being under network um you would have to just play
[01:01:00 - 01:01:06] around and see what doctors and health care are being taken this information um most
[01:01:06 - 01:01:11] sales aren't going to be like that um it's only a big concern if there's like people that go to
[01:01:11 - 01:01:16] the hospital quite frequently um but most of the time it's just people that are looking for free
[01:01:16 - 01:01:21] health insurance um they're accustomed to getting free health insurance they don't they're healthy
[01:01:21 - 01:01:27] they're young um they just don't want to pay too much that's pretty much your main clientele
[01:01:30 - 01:01:34] okay and then we'll go back to the script here we'll go a little quick guys
[01:01:46 - 01:01:50] okay so let's say I found a great policy here so I found a policy that's being taken on
[01:01:50 - 01:01:57] NPN override that's covering them insulin I would go on uh I'll go on details
[01:01:58 - 01:02:03] like details see all the options here and I would say uh miss I found a great policy here through
[01:02:03 - 01:02:10] blue cross blue field um all of your preventative cares such as anal checkups uh pop smears
[01:02:10 - 01:02:17] blood and lab work full on oscaris anal checkups routine blood and lab work will be covered
[01:02:17 - 01:02:23] fully at 100% now if you do need to see a doctor during the year for anything else
[01:02:23 - 01:02:31] uh your primary care doctor uh hope hey it's going to be at no charge after the deductible's met
[01:02:31 - 01:02:41] and then to see a specialist is only going to be 50% after the deductible was met um now uh with
[01:02:41 - 01:02:47] this option miss you're going to receive a zero dollar monthly premium um at a five thousand
[01:02:47 - 01:02:53] dollar deductible with a nine thousand dollar out of pocket maximum what that means is god forbid you
[01:02:53 - 01:02:58] have a surgery of one million dollars you're never going to have to surpass that nine thousand
[01:02:59 - 01:03:10] limit does that all make sense yeah that sounds good perfect and um I do have that that plan
[01:03:10 - 01:03:16] does help with some of these calls after the government assistance uh was added it brings down
[01:03:16 - 01:03:21] the total premium from two thousand seventy eight dollars to zero dollars per month meaning
[01:03:21 - 01:03:25] you're not going to have to pay anything on a per month basis for that option how does that sound

[01:07:24 - 01:07:27] because it's a little different with the script versus how it's done with
[01:07:28 - 01:07:35] the application use it as a as a good rubric um when you come when when you come in terms to
[01:07:35 - 01:07:40] upset and whatnot and how to pitch the policy but you don't have to read a word by word
[01:07:40 - 01:07:45] everybody's got their own way of speaking and you want to make this kind of a natural so
[01:07:46 - 01:07:53] you don't have to read a word by word um so from there I'm going to run into some issues because
[01:07:53 - 01:07:59] I've been into a school show but let's see if all we go here you put the phone number
[01:08:00 - 01:08:04] you want to click on send paper notices in the mail so they can receive their physical insurance
[01:08:04 - 01:08:20] cards it's going to sync with the marketplace always do you want to see if you're eligible for
[01:08:20 - 01:08:25] call savings guys these questions you don't have to ask you just say yes that's just see that's
[01:08:25 - 01:08:31] you grant her for subsidies um here you already asked this question at the beginning of
[01:08:31 - 01:08:38] of the pitch um when they had Medicare, Medicaid, EPA, drug care or any other health coverage
[01:08:38 - 01:08:42] if you just follow the script you won't have to ask it again um but if you want to play the
[01:08:42 - 01:08:51] safe just ask twice that then are you married answer yes I would type in all the information
[01:08:51 - 01:08:56] just for the sake of time I missed my past that just for the past time no
[01:09:02 - 01:09:11] Mr. Curly spoke any cigarettes as of right now no perfect and miss are you currently incarcerated

[01:09:21 - 01:09:25] no perfect and these questions are optional skip them
[01:09:26 - 01:09:33] it's optional you skip them um if you get this question is joined a naturalizer
[01:09:33 - 01:09:38] derived citizen nine out of ten times it's because the social is wrong or you missed
[01:09:38 - 01:09:42] something about her first or last name or the bigger something is wrong with how you type the
[01:09:42 - 01:09:52] information um so double verify and go back if you see this make sure that the social is right
[01:09:52 - 01:10:01] or what not um and then continue um and once you actually come to the enrollment portion you're
[01:10:01 - 01:10:08] going to want to check the NPN override sheet once more and make sure that you see the you're

[01:10:37 - 01:10:45] either amy's or kialas name huh um it'll happen automatically I can't do it because I gave
[01:10:45 - 01:10:55] a wrong social um and then it'll pop up there though and we'll just uh click it

[01:13:45 - 01:13:52] critical illness the way i pitch them is to kind of talk bad about the policy deductible once
[01:13:52 - 01:13:57] they're enrolled and say hey this is out of pocket maybe too expensive let's see if we can get to a
[01:13:59 - 01:14:05] a uh critical illness portion that will give you immediate coverage i got a bit of something
[01:14:05 - 01:14:10] what happened to you so let me pull this up and you guys are going to receive this
[01:14:11 - 01:14:20] after the meeting we're going to post it for everybody it's going to be through past day
[01:14:51 - 01:15:09] while my computer is focused on my tabs um you're going to get to this page we're going to
[01:15:09 - 01:15:21] click on quote in a rule um yeah hey how do we get the next that page we're gonna we're gonna
[01:15:21 - 01:15:45] send you the credentials to log in yeah yes uh nika have a question yeah yeah go ahead
[01:15:46 - 01:15:51] if most of these people are wanting zero dollar premiums um what percentage of them are going
[01:15:51 - 01:15:59] to pay extra for critical illness or dental one out of seven one out of eight okay dental vision
[01:15:59 - 01:16:05] or critical illness yeah um more than anything it's going to be your your dental
[01:16:05 - 01:16:13] looking for them okay but if you sell critical illness now when i show you you'll get a hundred
[01:16:13 - 01:16:18] percent of the commissions i just i'm gonna change the commissions um for critical illness for a hundred
[01:16:18 - 01:16:27] percent um and the critical illnesses can be up to eighty a hundred dollars um thank you sweet man thank you
[01:16:27 - 01:16:34] oh yeah so tell me something it's a critical illness kind of like a hospital indemnity or
[01:16:35 - 01:16:41] you know what's what's the deal with critical illness uh like a max your max out of pocket
[01:16:41 - 01:16:46] like oh i see a max out of pocket it's nine thousand dollars you know in any case something happens
[01:16:46 - 01:16:51] you like this it there is a surgery that costs like fifty grand and you're responsible for nine
[01:16:51 - 01:16:56] how you know how how would you like to get some something that's like a gap that that fills
[01:16:56 - 01:17:02] that gap for you for a couple of dollars a month as i sound you know somewhere somewhere around that
[01:17:02 - 01:17:08] i'm sorry about my microphone i took it away from my mouth but what exactly is the critical illness
[01:17:09 - 01:17:15] um because i've never sold it like hospital indemnity yeah you know it's a pretty similar it's
[01:17:15 - 01:17:21] like uh so imagine you get you get a person enrolled into a zero dollar plan but they're deductible
[01:17:21 - 01:17:27] is four thousand five thousand dollars um a hospital indemnity plan maybe they just want to
[01:17:27 - 01:17:34] you know um pick up uh speak to a certain specialist and that specialist uh let them see that
[01:17:34 - 01:17:40] you have to pay the deductible price you see the specialist um so you pitch the policy to say hey
[01:17:40 - 01:17:44] listen this policy that we enrolled you in it's a great policy in case god forbid something
[01:17:44 - 01:17:50] where it happened to you in the meantime if you do need to see your doctor repeatedly i would
[01:17:50 - 01:17:57] recommend we add you a hospital indemnity policy um at xyz cost through all state um it's going to
[01:17:57 - 01:18:02] come in at eighty dollars and that's going to cover your your co-pays moving forward or if it's a
[01:18:02 - 01:18:08] critical illness you say hey this policy it's going to be uh you have a eight thousand dollar deductible
[01:18:08 - 01:18:16] in case of of you having a god forbid a heart attack or a critical illness by this policy itself
[01:18:16 - 01:18:22] it's going to cover you and grant you fifty thousand dollars um if something works your god forbid a
[01:18:22 - 01:18:29] curve on this route incur an added safety net to the policy that you currently have and then
[01:18:29 - 01:18:35] use the update if they buy if they want to proceed or not a lot of the times what for the critical
[01:18:35 - 01:18:39] illness it's if you're pitching people that are accustomed to paying a lot of money for their
[01:18:39 - 01:18:46] insurance and they don't realize it so if you got if if um anybody that comes from not selling
[01:18:46 - 01:18:51] zero dollar plans but others for the policies that cost over a hundred two hundred dollars
[01:18:51 - 01:18:57] if you hitch a policy that's too low a little cost they get suspicious so the critical illness
[01:18:57 - 01:19:03] can be added to kind of dissuade them from this tradition they're they're just not too informed
[01:19:03 - 01:19:07] of how subsidies work or what um so if they're accustomed to paying two hundred dollars yeah they're
[01:19:07 - 01:19:11] accustomed to paying two hundred dollars they think because it's two hundred dollars it's a better
[01:19:11 - 01:19:15] time than a hundred dollars you know what wrong with this saying it's zero man what's going on
[01:19:16 - 01:19:22] yeah yeah i know i know they think it's a scam so might as well um get them on better policy
[01:19:22 - 01:19:28] and with the critical illness benefit you know uh fifty thousand dollar across the board
[01:19:28 - 01:19:30] i'm going to show you i'm gonna show you i'm gonna show you i'm gonna show you i'm gonna show you
[01:19:30 - 01:19:34] it's per event incident right i mean yeah it's pretty cool i mean i mean i did i did hospital
[01:19:34 - 01:19:40] demities but yeah so and this which will quick do marketplace transfer we're not having to do
[01:19:40 - 01:19:47] that are we just think guarantee that we're not going to do that what that there's an 80% chance of
[01:19:47 - 01:19:54] we're not going to do it and that's awesome and the hourly people get the full commission on the
[01:19:56 - 01:20:02] critical illness that's a change no sir no sir they're separate commissions
[01:20:03 - 01:20:07] so are we getting a hundred percent of the commission on hospital and demnied as well
[01:20:08 - 01:20:14] only critical illness uh are they differing or are you also i'll tell you let me show you a little
[01:20:14 - 01:20:22] poll here you got it um Nick do you want me to just come on slack on Monday morning and see what you
[01:20:22 - 01:20:29] can do to help me i'll keep you posted yeah okay so here's your once you're on the page uh you're
[01:20:29 - 01:20:35] just gonna go here quote on a roll put the effective date put today's date you want to charge

[01:20:40 - 01:20:55] 2025 um they're based on three three zero zero nine date of birth of June 18th six seven seven
[01:20:55 - 01:21:04] mail yeah i can't wait to get in some of this uh we'll do well with answer all right
[01:21:16 - 01:21:19] right just click in the little calendar and picking today that might clear it
[01:21:24 - 01:21:29] and i also saw the head life insurance as well we even saw life insurance i saw that in that video
[01:21:30 - 01:21:36] 150,000 dollar policy um yes it would be
[01:21:37 - 01:21:47] burn life wait so you'll pay us a hundred percent on that too for commission people uh yes
[01:21:48 - 01:21:54] that's great man thank you sir no worries it's
[01:22:11 - 01:22:26] well i'm sorry i'm stupid my bad um really it's 150 yeah they said it only works if you make it effective
[01:22:26 - 01:22:32] tomorrow but i guess they didn't specify about weekends or at least available i don't know
[01:22:32 - 01:22:53] always that little calendar on the left one there we go there we go i don't know why um okay i just
[01:22:53 - 01:22:58] put the early date no worries um so i mean it's not gonna happen let's just do photo
[01:22:58 - 01:23:05] something they're all the same policy within the whole country um you type in all their name you
[01:23:05 - 01:23:29] probably already have that because you close them with all um skip that uh that should provide and
[01:23:29 - 01:23:34] then you would just click on the options here so if you wanted to pitch for term medical i wouldn't
[01:23:34 - 01:23:44] worry too much about your term medical i would just focus on dental dental fixed and dental accident
[01:23:44 - 01:23:49] um cancer and heart stroke i would just worry about dental accident cancer
[01:23:55 - 01:23:57] yeah you'll see all the options here and then you're just
[01:24:01 - 01:24:27] asked or don't worry about that
[01:24:32 - 01:24:35] let me see put a different answer
[01:24:41 - 01:24:45] so wait you just have to enter their information once and you can see all the different types of
[01:24:45 - 01:24:48] things they could get just like clicking those arrows down the left
[01:24:48 - 01:24:55] putting on shame that is sweet i'm used to having to retive everything
[01:24:55 - 01:24:59] there we go there we go it's like user friendly it's user friendly so yeah you'll have the dental
[01:24:59 - 01:25:07] options the i would only worry about dental um cancer heart stroke but term lies
[01:25:07 - 01:25:13] can we get it he showed that yesterday term life yep you could do term life um the dental
[01:25:13 - 01:25:18] envision it's kind of weird you're gonna have to add a twelve dollar you're gonna have to click
[01:25:18 - 01:25:24] add and you're gonna have to add a separate um product that's gonna be twelve dollar minimum
[01:25:24 - 01:25:29] 32 purchase it's weird how it works so if you get them up all through and you pitch it as a 59
[01:25:29 - 01:25:36] dollar dental um mention hey we can get you a $43 dental it's gonna also include um separate
[01:25:36 - 01:25:42] coverage for critical onalist um at $13.50 one sentence we're gonna have works but you have all
[01:25:42 - 01:25:48] these options i would just pitch and dental critical on this if they're looking for more coverage
[01:25:48 - 01:25:53] because maybe they're not happy with the deductible whatever it may be um this is a perfect candidate
[01:25:53 - 01:26:00] pitch this product user people complaining about the deductibles um dental as if they want dental
[01:26:00 - 01:26:06] these are the dental plans just so you know they're through uh at none they're under the network
[01:26:06 - 01:26:12] of at best you can pitch them as at policies okay and so that critical illness that's gonna be
[01:26:13 - 01:26:22] 11 times 12 that we have paid or just the first premiums it's it's the monthly premium so for
[01:26:22 - 01:26:29] the dental if you pitch them a 54 dollar plan it's gonna be 100% of the of the 54 dollars and 95
[01:26:29 - 01:26:39] that's okay so yes and that's gonna be for term life cancer and all that just uh um yeah i
[01:26:40 - 01:26:51] so dental um accident i wouldn't worry too much about um i would worry about dental cancer and
[01:26:51 - 01:26:59] heart stroke these are phenomenal plans um yeah they're really good plans um you can add
[01:27:01 - 01:27:06] the issues you can you have limits of how much you can add with cancer limits so you can
[01:27:06 - 01:27:11] supplement it with term you can kind of bundle like yeah but i would bundle like cancer and heart
[01:27:11 - 01:27:18] stroke with AD&D so accidental death and dismemberment yeah yeah i forgot what Paul said the the
[01:27:18 - 01:27:27] dental covers um yep so your dental is gonna cover your or it's gonna cover two um white
[01:27:27 - 01:27:37] cleanings a year your checkups um and root canal extractions dentures um i'm gonna cover everything
[01:27:38 - 01:27:46] um don't do anything i yeah it's gonna cover except implants no except implants um yeah
[01:27:48 - 01:27:57] got it that is awesome yeah there's no waiting period um with these dental plans you know how to make
[01:27:57 - 01:28:05] you wait 12 months no waiting periods or yeah what about dentures no dentures
[01:28:05 - 01:28:09] yeah and so the dental plans are with all state
[01:28:10 - 01:28:18] etna etna think dental or etna etna okay i'm sorry i know it's not all state that's
[01:28:19 - 01:28:22] no it's a little confusing because all states are father company yeah it's a little confusing
[01:28:22 - 01:28:28] just think of dental etna anything that's that's what you can put it as you can put it as all state
[01:28:28 - 01:28:36] later yeah i'm the one i said i'll say okay thanks yeah no worries all right team
[01:28:36 - 01:28:51] uh so dental so obviously dental is pretty self-explanatory critical illness um cancer and heart stroke
[01:28:52 - 01:29:01] um these options would classify as critical illness coverage okay i see what you're saying okay

[01:30:45 - 01:30:52] scp for um right if they had an npn needed coverage for consent or somebody said we could probably do
[01:30:52 - 01:30:55] scp won't even apply because you're in open enrollment
[01:30:56 - 01:31:00] no no for December they wouldn't need an scp if they need coverage

=== FULL TRANSCRIPT (CONTINUOUS TEXT) ===

You know, everybody here, the first thing that we're going to go over is the dialer information. So if you did not receive your dialer information, you're not going to be working tomorrow.  We have either pending information or we received your information late or setting you up in a different payroll for a lot of the based in commission.  We have payroll tracks with the hours that you're working. So it's a bit more complex. If you already received your login information, you're good to start tomorrow at 10 a.m.  Hey, the user name and log. This is Frank. You probably know that the user name and login did not work.  It's something something's in valid. Oh, all you're going to do is remove the space in between agent and 2025.  Right. Yeah, it might work. I missed that. I saw the link. Minds is user name.  Yeah, there is no space. So that's not the concern.  It was when it was sent when it was sent to me. There was. Yeah, so you know, no problem. I tried it twice. I typed it in and cut and pasted it and they weren't either time.  We're really trying to log in right now. And for anybody that has issues, let me know.  They'll talk about that. But there's just racism checking this right now.  I have a question for you, Nick, because I'm already loved and then I'm trying to like make sure that my connection and everything is okay.  Just in case I maybe have to move to another room or something, you know, just to make sure things are right and there's no problems that I'm trying to call my own phone.  And for some reason, it's not allowed me to call myself like I test my microphone, but that's not the issue.  I want to hear it like on the phone. Yeah, I'm sorry. I just got to deal with. Yeah, it's not going to work.  Just yeah. No. Yeah.  Okay.  Nick, I have the link. I just don't have a user name or password.  I don't know if they were supposed to come to me in a in a private message.  I just sent you information. I tried to do that to temporarily password.  Um, to who was speaking.  Mark.  Okay.  Okay.  On here.  Nick, if we're if we're going to the people who start on.  Guys, guys, one by one.  I got to deal with one by one.  Okay. Yeah, everybody else was speaking. So I'm sorry. I thought it was okay.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I got to deal with one person by one person.  Okay. So I'm talking. I'm going to talk now.  Um, the people who are going to start Monday, such as me, which I don't mind because I'm too tired from working at my job.  So I'll start Monday.  Um, so how do I get my dollar and pay core?  Third way from this. I got to talk up.  I'm going to count.  Margie, what is this?  Um, I never received a user name and password.  Unless I'm.  My brand did it out.  I figured I'd throw it in while you're writing it down.  Everybody.  Everybody.  Have yourself muted.  And also no banking information.  I certainly mean yourself.  Yeah, I sent you my pay core.  And I got the, uh, the link for the engage cloud. Just know user name and password.  And then I have a few scripting questions when we can get to that too.  Yeah, everybody has a bunch of questions.  Well, we're going to get to everybody's questions at the end of the meeting.  I just want to go through a few things.  Perfect. Thank you.  No worries.  Feel about it.  Uh, I was in a Slack message.  Yeah.  Thanks.  And then if that doesn't work, I sent you a backup temporary password.  All right.  Our next question.  Are we in line?  I don't want to speak out because people miss. Oh, she's speaking.  Who's next?  And then when can I be in the line?  So.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm going to have the good news.  Monica, go ahead.  Okay.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, I heard.  Okay.  Thank you.  Uh, so I used the login.  And it says 401 authorization required.  Oh, I tried different.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, try different browser.  Um, you may need to go.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  So like I want to start on Monday anyway.  And because, like I said, I was so overworked for my other job.  So how can I get the links to start on Monday?  The winners.  It's nothing personal.  Um,  We just have contracting that's being done on the behalf of other people  who are waiting for their.  From their answer come through.  So we have.  Oh.  Okay.  So there's a possibility.  I mean,  I start on Monday.  I had everything in.  I thought.  Um,  No, we just don't have your.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Um, no.  No, we don't have your home state license.  Really?  Yeah.  We don't have your home state.  I'm looking at your right now.  Yeah.  Somebody we showed for a home state license.  Um,  and then your PDB.  My wife.  Your PDB report.  So you're.  Oh, I thought it was.  Yeah, I kept asking if I had those things and you say,  Oh, you're good, I thought I had a man.  So what can I do now?  How can I get those?  Just add it to me.  I'll try to let them know that you're on high priority  because you want to start Monday.  But even then, it's a lot of some of the agents  were here about two, three weeks ago.  So there's just a priority.  Oh, I've been here a couple of weeks.  I've been coming to the meetings every single night.  Every night you would tell me I'm good.  I've sent that PDP, you say it was good.  And you said, you even told me today, Monday, you can start.  And now you're telling me you don't have the things  that are needed.  I've been in the chat like every day.  I know, Vanessa.  Vanessa, you joined the 21st of October.  It's what we're doing, everything in our power.  So you guys are on board it.  We want to get to work and trust us.  I'm just, like I mentioned, that there's a lot of parts.  I'm pushing for you to start asking as possible.  As soon as you raise my hand, it goes down.  So I'll be posted and I'll let you know.  Yeah, because I mean, it should be the third and the number.  Sorry.  I'm ready by accident, Vanessa.  Little to talk to anybody who thinks they sent in their state  license, but you think they didn't.  I was sending mine as the PDF.  And it needs the last four of your social code to log in.  I had to change it and copy and paste it  into like a word document for you to be able to see it.  Yes, thank you.  Vanessa, go ahead.  I didn't mean to meet you.  OK, can you hear me?  Yeah, and I heard it.  Yeah, so I'm very stressed out.  And I had the principal of the school called me  and told me to come help because people  were stranded in Jamaica, some teachers.  So I didn't help children.  And so I'm a hard working person.  I used to be a school teacher.  And I just was, you know, temporarily helping there.  So I said, no, I have another job to go to now.  So I mean, I don't want to be without a job.  I took this because I wanted a job in a full-time job  for until January.  So, you know, I don't know what to do now.  Vanessa, do you tell me, at the last minute,  you don't have my state, you don't have this in there.  And I've been asking like every day.  And I mean, I'm from Louisiana, but I'm not ignorant.  I have worked insurance for years,  and I used to be a school teacher.  My daughter is a doctor.  I have a daughter as an accountant.  We are intelligent people.  Vanessa, I'm with you.  I'm not against you.  I'm trying to help you out.  There's a lot of moving parts.  It's not up to me to get you on boarded.  There's people in the back and then you  need to get to properly set up through healthcare.gov.  So you can receive the phone calls.  It's not, we're doing everything out of power, Vanessa.  So, if it's not the third, it will be the time.  But we'll keep you posted.  OK, when can I get with you to see when I can start working?  Because I guess I just don't need to be in this meeting.  I've been, I mean, I've worked with autistic children,  so on time.  OK, Vanessa, just in your stand, and it's a pleasure.  Everybody, if you're on base plus commission,  you're on a different payroll as a person that would be just  on commission.  If you wanted to start working immediately,  I could get you on working pretty quickly  through the commission payroll.  But if you, since we're setting you up on base plus commission,  the payroll takes track of the hours  that you're on the dialet.  Does that make sense?  So, it's a bit more complex than you wish to do base plus commission.  There's more moving cars to it than behind the scenes.  Yeah, I was starting on Monday to do the base plus commission.  Like, if you're not able to start,  like, this Monday would have to be another Monday, or I didn't know of that.  You mentioned the third or the tenth, right?  I didn't know if that would be a difference.  I'm sorry, for out of respect for Vanessa.  I just want to answer the question.  So, Vanessa, if it is something that you need to resolve  urgently, I recommend I could get anybody here on the dialer.  They wish to be on commission just because of the payroll works  to an immediate fix.  If not, you may have to wait until Monday for the new arrangements.  Yeah, I didn't want to work tomorrow anyway, to be honest.  Like I said, I'm stressed out from work.  So, trying to help them people, those children,  they're stressed out.  They say they don't have a teacher, you know.  Yeah, so what do you worry about?  We're in the same page, then.  You're going to...  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Joe, Joe, let's go ahead.  I can't raise my hand to just let me know when I can jump in.  Hey, I'm sorry about that.  I didn't see Joe F. I'm sorry.  I forgot.  You know, I was just thinking about my name.  I'm sorry about that.  So, we're good from Monday on the base plus commission.  You should be as long as you submitted all the paperwork  and not this far away.  All right.  But how about me?  You got my paperwork, you got it online on your email.  And you asked me to resubmit inside of your...  Inside of Slack, right?  But you had my information for some time.  So, am I good?  Or what's my situation?  Yeah.  Again, there's a lot of moving parts.  So, if you're on base plus commission, we're anticipating  that you should be starting Monday.  We're doing everything on our part for you to start Monday.  First case scenario, as we said to regions about two weeks, a week ago.  For anybody that's submitting paperwork this week,  which anticipates the start to 10th of November,  but we're pushing everything to get you started this Monday.  No, I totally got you.  See, my thing is that my paperwork wasn't submitted this week.  My paperwork was submitted, but it was submitted by email.  Right?  I submitted it to you by email, Nicholas.  So, I'm wondering...  It's not a matter of...  of being the proper thing or whatnot.  It has to go through a few people for them to approve.  No, I totally get it.  I totally get it.  I'm just trying to pull all transparency.  I'm just trying to figure it out.  Right?  Now, let's say that I came on and I came on on a basis of commission.  Can I switch over immediately when...  You know what I mean?  You know, I went to the commission.  I went from...  Oh, sorry.  I muted your last accident.  I mentioned something else.  I'm sorry.  I went from to a commission standpoint.  Right?  For...  I mean, the base plus commission, I was...  I was like, okay, let me...  Let me give it a shot.  You know, I'm not going to have Anne better.  I'm not going to have, you know, UAC.  Let me see what it's like and let me see what the script is like.  Let me see...  Because I've never sold on a healthcare.gov platform.  Right?  So, I don't know...  I don't know, like, you know,  like, commission sales could be the roof.  You know what I mean?  I just wanted to put my foot in the water before I went to straight commission.  You know?  You know, within the first hour,  it's worth it or not,  because you make sales within the first hour.  So, it's a quick sales cycle.  So, you'll know if you're good within the first hour.  But...  But I was really looking for a base plus commission thing, you know,  and that was very attractive.  You know, you can still do it.  It's going to take a...  It's just going to anticipate that you may have to start this Monday  or we're spacing out at 1.1.  Okay.  Now, if I was starting on commission, right,  could I just move straight to base plus commission?  Is that something that I can do?  No.  You see, so...  See, that's...  That's what puts me in a corner.  So, listen, there's nothing personal here.  It's all business.  I just understand that you've been more than kind.  Right?  So, I'm just trying to move with you how you need me to move.  But the base plus commission was a thing for me, you know,  because I don't have like certain carriers.  I'm blocky.  You see that I was O'Neill.  You know what I mean?  So, you know, I'm kind of blocked off.  Yeah, that's why you're right.  I mean, however you was.  We'll go ahead.  We'll...  Yeah, can you hear me?  Yes.  Yeah.  So, I got confused on when you said that the reason,  why that is the ones that says base...  The ones that wants to do base plus commission start on Monday.  And if you want to go quicker, you have to start in commissions.  If you want to do a Saturday,  you said that the reason why it's like that is because of the pay structure.  I'm kind of confused on that.  Because you said that the...  The technicality.  It's the dialer.  It's the dialer.  Yeah, it's the dialer.  The dialer.  So, there's two payrolls.  There's payroll for people that work on commission.  And there's payroll for people that work on a base plus commission.  Since we're going to be paying you a...  For the people that want to do base plus commission,  we have to track the amount of hours that you guys are going to be working.  And we do the dialer.  And you can't check the hours on...  You can't do...  You can't check the hours if we start on Saturday.  Because the dialer is still going to be used.  So, that's one of the things.  It's something in the back and it takes longer to process.  There's a lot of moving parts.  I mean, we're doing every...  Trust me.  If we could, we would.  We're pushing everything that we can.  We're speaking to admins.  We're pushing forward base plus commission people.  I mean, I've always mentioned it.  That it...  If you're coming on new,  bear with us.  We're going to do everything in our power.  So, you guys are starting as soon as possible.  You just have to be a bit...  Oh!  If you want to do base plus commission,  it's just a two-day difference.  Of course, case scenario 10th of November.  I don't anticipate it going there.  I'm doing everything in my power.  I stayed here 18 hours.  So, I'm really trying to do everything in my power here.  So, it's nothing personal.  There's just a lot of contingencies.  All right.  And I do...  I'll move forward here.  Because there's a lot of hands.  Can you buy...  Okay.  Can you see my report real quick?  We were steamed all your paperwork  by the 25th of October.  We were steamed your driver's license  from the Saturday, 25th of October.  And it was posted to our box rubbed  with some really information.  So, the process, the 26th,  we're just pending on that.  We're just pending on your...  your approval in your dialed information.  All right.  No problem.  So, I just have to wait for my paid court and dialer, correct?  If you want to do the base plus commission, yeah.  If you want to do the commission,  that's probably going to be a bit faster, yeah.  All right.  Sure.  Let's go.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  My question's kind of pretty brief.  I just kind of want to know with our carrier selection,  kind of just being very tight.  Do you expect that there would be any kind of hindrance  to the amount of enrollments we would make  based on the carrier selection that we have?  Or do you think it's same as last year  we should be able to rip and run?  Same as last year.  Blue Cross Rouge Field is going to be offered  with in all zip codes.  It's the most favorite carrier by anybody.  Everybody likes Blue Cross Rouge Field  and it's offered in all zip codes.  Awesome.  Only thing is we're going to be South Carolina.  But you're not going to get, yeah,  besides that, most of them are Blue Cross Rouge.  So, it shouldn't be part of that.  Thank you, Nick.  Let me go with Miss Chapman.  Yeah, super quick.  I was wondering, are you going over your script this evening, Nick?  At all.  Were you speaking to that or just buttoning up  everything else with onboarding?  onboarding.  I can read.  I can send you out the script.  I posted the training with the script.  No, you're personal.  You're slow.  Yours.  Do you have a recording?  We're going to need record recordings or?  We do.  Yeah.  On the cloud.  This black enough.  You have the script itself, correct?  Yes.  Yes, sir.  I have that.  I just wanted to hear your flow.  At the end, at the end, everything's recorded.  At the end, I'm going to go over a hell strip of enrollment  for the last time.  Okay.  Okay.  And the last time.  Okay.  Thank you.  The team.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  How long is this meeting?  Is this going to be like another Q&A?  Because I was under the impression that this was really mandatory for the people who are really starting tomorrow.  And this was really like important.  So, just respect to anybody like who was on here asking questions.  However, like, I just need to get the information because it is late.  You know, these meetings are really late.  And if it was information that he needed to go over, I would really appreciate it.  If we really keep it short and like let him get everything, he needs to get out.  And then write your questions down, put them in a chat or whatever.  Save it to the end.  Because it's so many of us.  And then some of us like, you know, you're not the only ones here.  And we got to like really, like be mindful of that.  So that's what I need to know.  Like, how much longer do I need to be on this call?  Because I start in the morning.  So I need to get whatever information that you needed for me to get.  You got it.  And so you received your dialer.  Were you able to log into your dialer?  No, except for that thing that I told you about earlier, where I've trying to, you know, call out to my phone.  And try to see how it sounds.  I couldn't do it.  But other than that, it was successful.  Yeah. You should be good tomorrow morning.  As long as you got the dialer, you're in a whole Sherpa.  You know how to work the end pinover ride sheet.  There's no reason for you to stay.  If you have all that, I'm just tracking that everybody's good to go tomorrow.  So we're verifying.  If you know how to work, just have.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not new to ACA.  I'm pretty familiar.  So I'm going to be right.  But like a question.  I'm still speaking.  But yeah, that's all I needed to know.  Thank you.  No worries.  Vicki, go ahead.  Yeah, I cannot get into my dialer.  What does it say when you try to?  Yeah.  I get it.  Okay.  It's invalid input in correct user name or password.  Maybe the temporary password.  Yes.  That's your slot for this.  Wait, hold on.  I've had a deal with this.  I was on the phone all day with the marketplace about this.  This is like a big thing that's happening is it for integrating and new health Sherpa account.  Second matter.  I just sent you your.  Okay.  Let me check it out.  It's going to be.  Yeah.  Try that password.  If that helps.  Oh, yeah.  I see that.  Okay.  Thank you.  Let me know what that was.  One moment here.  Hey, Nick.  Can I make one quick statement?  And then I can probably get off here.  This is Frank Francis.  Yeah.  All right.  So what you're with this.  Ambient override sheet.  That's just basically we need to use the those agents information.  What we're saying goes carries in those states, right?  That's that's how we're when we when we do the application on Sherpa.  Yes.  You'll see an NP override option.  You're going to have to write under these agents within these characters.  Yes.  All right.  So perfect.  So I think I'm good to go.  You were great.  Nick.  Yes.  You've been putting many hours in.  You were slacking last night at three, three, forty or something like that.  So yes, Nick.  You were great.  I appreciate it.  Fair for.  You may have Nick.  My name.  You're in awesome.  Yes.  Thank you.  No worries.  Was everybody else able to get in or does anybody else have any practices logging into the dialogue?  I was able to get in as well.  Using firefox.  So thank you.  Firefox.  Yes.  Yeah.  Richard Hale says they can't get in.  Richard Hale.  What is.  I'm still getting the 401 authorization required I tried both chrome and edge both I don't  have Firefox on my computer I guess I can download it yeah I tried to download it because  I have it too I go and you know I'm not it doesn't work Firefox has been my only solution  okay I'll download it now okay Nick everything's working for me Nick some I'm gonna go ahead  and jump out here okay all right all right thank you sir I think I'm all set as well  I've got the npn over edge sheet I'll log in and health syrup already to go so I will  see you tomorrow Nick perfect the scripting questions I have I think everybody's gonna  have once they get into it though so that's why I wanted to ask those before people started  hopping off what scripting questions for example in the income qualification wouldn't it  be your 2026 best guess oh for the projected annual income yeah it would be their 2025  best guess because what they're gonna file for the it's they're gonna file taxes in the  year of 2026 for their 2025 taxes right but we're selling them 2026 insurance so  since that year they're guessing the income for because all this year I was asking 2025  best guess income yeah I just asked them for the year because when they filed their taxes so 2026  of April you're gonna file your taxes for the year of 2025 yeah but that's what applies to  your 2025 ACA insurance no yeah you're thinking it so it would be this year what it was to  protect that income for this year for because April you're gonna file for the past year's  income statement yeah all right I'll say 2025 if you want but I don't think that's right but also  at verifications we need the correct email address to give them it gives some funky company that  and we need a customer service number to give them at the referral section yeah did you receive  a we're in the meeting where where they sent out all the the actual shared document or the description  sorry I muted you by accident meant to meet somebody else guys if you're talking just  to talk over go ahead I'm sorry miss I lost you I muted you by accident I was trying to meet some  oh sorry yeah so when I look at that but at least last time I looked at that live script it still  had no phone number for the customer service number that we're supposed to give them in the  referral section and it had still the wrong email to give them to in the verifications where it says  you know to cancel this email us at it had some other company in there will send me your email  address or we sent out a live document kind of like a Google Street where you can see any changes  made because the other is the fewest but we modified it to ensure documents so I can send it over to you  if you have a email I just want to see if anybody could hear me because they hadn't  up any able to talk this entire meeting yeah you got to raise your hand I'm going on by  no I can't raise my hand that's what I've been trying to say yeah I can't I don't have a hand  raised thing either today sorry that's why I've been hopping and then the objections link on  that live document was dead not that I care about if anybody needed it and then I don't know if  we're setting up voicemails and stuff and that contact card in the dialer oh yeah I wouldn't  worry about that okay all right so I'll send you my email and we'll see if the document looks  different thank you now worries may I ask my questions yeah go ahead I just wanted to know if I'm  a Saturday or a Monday so I know I had to prepare myself for tonight yes I'm a base plus  commission person then yeah you're not let me see what you may be tomorrow what's her name  Scott wine brand spot your application still pending we still didn't receive your work schedule  I sent it to you a bunch of times and slackened by email you sent me an empty screen you sent me  no and then and then I resented I don't know why it turned empty but I've resented a bunch of times  that I actually emailed it to you too I mean Monday is not a big deal for Saturday but I don't want  to go another week and I could send it to you right now and you could tell me if you see it  yeah um because it's

the MPN over right here when  we use the name are we going to actually use an MPN or just their name override so it'll still  up as an often MPN override you're going to want to click on uh their name it makes for the  the carrier that you're selling as attached to their name so for example in textist you're only  going to be able to sell these carriers not going to want to sell any other carrier otherwise you're  not going to get the commission for it so you just want to sell and from textist under Amy Michelson  or blue i got it but i'm just wondering when we put their actual name it'll come up as an option  to select it should yeah yeah it should okay and you're certain we're not doing three-way calls it  it's very where if any if we have to use all right um there's no certain tncms but i'm 80% sure  yeah okay and uh think yeah with just to me the script and um i think that was it thank you  no worries um i don't have access to the actual script but i told the team manager  um for

Nicholas i'm  gonna be your agent moving forward i'm here with insurance aca um i got you in a recorded line my  job here's to help you out search around some health options for you and see what subsidies you  may qualify for um can i start by asking are you looking for a plan for yourself for one for the  family or my family your family okay and in case we get this connected what would be a good  phone which we reach out to you okay um 806 505 1 2 3 4 okay then uh myth as of right now do you  currently have any health insurance because Medicaid Medicare VA try care or any health coverage  that you can aim off no perfect and who do i have the pleasure of speaking with uh what is your  first name list okay Joan Smith first and miss Smith i just want to make sure i have the correct  spelling it's j-o-n-e-s last name s-m-i-t-g-j-c-r-t no Joan j-o-n oh i see and miss what would be a good  date of birth for you um it's uh one twenty six nineteen fifty seven i'm just gonna put sixty seven  because you're in your choice sixty seven yeah all right and uh miss just to pull up all your  options here what is a good seat good for you a good one yeah will be a good seat because so we  can go through all the follows these operating area oh yeah uh seven six one three seven  seven six one three seven i got you your basehead attacks is correct right who must be hot out there  oh yeah it's barely starting to get a little cool barely this week  i know that i have a lot of bugs there it gets humid um all right and miss do i have your  consent to check the marketplace you've got information and your health options yes perfect so once  i get consent and she has to say yes um click this check mark and then you have access just  to some place you're asking the first piece of the information of consent which marketplace  your application and follow along with the script miss as a right now do you felt uh  taxes single or married married okay no worries and two two of the guys who haven't worked with  called Sherpa are you're gonna want to click on both both of these buttons scroll down click on  store consent outside of all Sherpa but we have consent to record it calls guys are asking consent  twice read the call we'll met the beginning of call and at the closing of the call so we'll  follow with the script um perfect okay and miss uh in order just to understand to qualify for  subsidies if you are married you must join uh you must follow your taxes stop now did you want  to include your your spouse or one of your children onto the policy to see if you do qualify for  subsidies yeah okay that would be great first now let me have them here and miss i just  need to double check you did follow your taxes for the year 2023 and 2020 correct yes perfect  and miss as best as you can what would you say your projected household income is for the year 2025  um for this year uh for 2025 yeah um it's gonna be uh it'll be uh 21,000  around 21,000 will come no worries um so just so you understand um out around that income bracket  i can get to subsidies independently um if you were to file your taxes independently um if we were to  include somebody else within the household uh you wouldn't qualify for any subsidies they would  more than likely just tell you to reach out to Medicaid directly which would be  hyperocratic you'd have to reach out to them or if i actually be approved for Medicaid  um now what i can do is i can see if we can get you approved for a policy independently and if it's  that good fit um it may be more affordable would that be something that um that you're open to miss  well what if my husband also has an income oh yeah well what would you say the projected  income is of the household yeah so it would be about uh 51,000  51,000 okay and uh between you and your husband do you guys have any children  yes oh yeah two girls and with any policy did you want to include them as well  yes okay of course no worries so long for both your husband and your two children here  um again guys just so you understand the more people that you bring on to a health insurance plan  the better compensation you're getting you're not getting paid for application you're getting paid  per person um so bear that in mind and um i'm going to come to this social at the end but i'm  following the script um as of right now miss what are you currently looking for in a health insurance  policy where you're looking to find a doctor with a network or you're looking to get sort of  medications covered what's got you're looking for health insurance yeah uh medication covered  and just make sure my doctor's cover yeah i know worries um what what is your what are the  medications you're currently taking miss um and take um uh glipa side  glipa side anything else besides that um and uh met foreman and i know you want to  and you probably have a intention of continuing seeing the same doctor correct you know when  to change out doctor yes right perfect so let's find the all those two that your doctor's going to  say uh what is the name of that doctor um see like um you can say i ran them like hospital or something  oh my doctor's the ex-wife hospital just a doctor speaker i'm trying to put it like if someone had  diabetes like all of this none of this applies to me but this is not my info but i'm just trying to  make it to just like if i had one that had diabetes like um doctor speaker sp a k e r she's just  a pcp but okay um no worries so i i would have like a no pad here and i would just write down all  that information so i can run us yeah okay and okay guys i'm just doing this so you guys can see um  okay uh no worries miss what i'm gonna do now is i'm just gonna put you in a brief hold um and i'm  gonna see what options you are eligible for that your doctors would take as well as  uh risky colors for your medications okay okay so realistically i would have everything written  down in you know no pad um i would have a no pads where you write all their information that way  you don't have to ask a whole times um everybody has a different way of doing things here i pulled up all  the information um and miss uh just to add your husband to the pulse to what is your husband's  fit of birth it's May 13th 1967 and your children's fit of birth as well  okay um march 15th um 1999 and your other third child's fit of birth  October 12th 2002 2002 oh it was it's birthday recently happy birthday 10  thank you no worries and you said the projected income of the household was around 55,000 correct  yeah with me and my husband was angry could you repeat the zip code one more time  seven six one three seven so her income right here her income is too low or a family of four they're  gonna want to take her to Medicaid um so what i would do is i would pose out um options to include her  kids and see if she would be granted a stuff study for both her and her husband but i actually  just maybe just because so what if the the child works so does that count uh yeah if they're  under 26 and they want to be in a family plan yeah and you can also add them their income  well they have to be under 26 that's the path for for somebody to receive insurance okay because she  is 26 oh okay yeah so she's 26 they're gonna clap they're not gonna be able to get out her  they're what if if she's 26 he's not gonna be able to get on a family plan 26 is like the cut-off  so 25 yeah good so put um you know put children 14 times just a four just a good idea  so we could just put like one like if i had just one child  yeah i mean it's it's they're with uh with a big beautiful bill they kind of change  a few things with yeah yeah what have the subsidies work i was just trying to make it easier for  you know just no i appreciate that um what are some of the things that they change with that big  beautiful bill um the how many how much subsidy is a percent diversity so okay i just put the  i just forgot to put the household members that's what it can't do okay i'm sick  14 but let's say instead 55,000 1976 was your date of birth is what you said and then how  did you say your husband was miss made 13th 1967 so yeah even with the 55,000 dollar income  you'd see that's the qualifies for fully subsidized plan um now what i would want you guys to do  is to see okay so you found all the options here that you want to get ideally a policy that's  gonna be zero dollars premium that way you don't have to ask for any card credit card or bank  accounting for mason it's kind of easy your sale um it's an order taking um and then pull up  and pin override you're going to go factor and pin override and you're going to want to find a  policy within the state of taxes that is that is your being offered so you'll see blue cross  bridge field great policy you guys can enroll in blue cross bridge fields um other blue cross  bridge fields ideally you want the blue cross bridge field with the lowest deductible um you can  also click on the blue cross bridge field taxes here to aim it out um but she also mentioned to  me that she's taking some medications you know if she's very worried about maybe she's taking  out expensive medications such as insulin um you can type in insulin and make sure that whatever  policy you get is going to cover it also add done click on this little tab and it'll tell you  a insulin's covering it so with the blue cross plan that we sell uh $900 or like a thousand  $200 medication would be covered it would only cost you $25 which is phenomenal um and then also  for example let's say Jennifer Lynn is her Jennifer speaker is the name of her medic we just go  here click on add doctor total doctor Jennifer speaker hold up speaker but you'll see pop-ups  of all the doctors here do you have to put dr first or you can put in their first name yeah it's  some some have doctors some don't some have it but it's best it's probably best if you type in  their full name if you know their full name um so let's say it's doctor mark speaker you click add  click done and you would select this option this option you want to find a policy that'll cover  both the doctor and the medications there's not too many options but if you want to  if she's not taking medications here let's do with doctors going to take it it's like it's a  picky doctor I'm not sure um this doctor is being under network um you would have to just play  around and see what doctors and health care are being taken this information um most  sales aren't going to be like that um it's only a big concern if there's like people that go to  the hospital quite frequently um but most of the time it's just people that are looking for free  health insurance um they're accustomed to getting free health insurance they don't they're healthy  they're young um they just don't want to pay too much that's pretty much your main clientele  okay and then we'll go back to the script here we'll go a little quick guys  okay so let's say I found a great policy here so I found a policy that's being taken on  NPN override that's covering them insulin I would go on uh I'll go on details  like details see all the options here and I would say uh miss I found a great policy here through  blue cross blue field um all of your preventative cares such as anal checkups uh pop smears  blood and lab work full on oscaris anal checkups routine blood and lab work will be covered  fully at 100% now if you do need to see a doctor during the year for anything else  uh your primary care doctor uh hope hey it's going to be at no charge after the deductible's met  and then to see a specialist is only going to be 50% after the deductible was met um now uh with  this option miss you're going to receive a zero dollar monthly premium um at a five thousand  dollar deductible with a nine thousand dollar out of pocket maximum what that means is god forbid you  have a surgery of one million dollars you're never going to have to surpass that nine thousand  limit does that all make sense yeah that sounds good perfect and um I do have that that plan  does help with some of these calls after the government assistance uh was added it brings down  the total premium from two thousand seventy eight dollars to zero dollars per month meaning  you're not going to have to pay anything on a per month basis for that option how does that sound  well that's great yes yes and miss uh your stuff were you looking for medical or did you  were you looking to include dental and basic uh for the family here today oh yeah we can get dental  yeah yeah um dental options just doing this and they're going to be ranging around  anywhere between 40 to 60 dollars here were you thinking of getting a dental option just  yourself for the whole family just for myself yeah I wouldn't want to have one okay no worries so  once we complete your application for your health insurance policy here today we'll get you  enrolled into some handsome insurance as well okay and from there that's when you  enroll in this plan start application no thanks continue with this plan go through  go through everything um yeah they're doing this because we're out of time I'm coming out  for enrollment but you would go through you would go through this portion I don't need to go veterans  here once again will you type in the information so mr. I got first name as trillion last name  smith expose the date of birth set of texas and miss I just want to make sure you do give me  consent to work on your behalf correct yes and then you always ask that before you search the market  place continue right here but where we left left off um and then I just want to make sure miss  I have the correct spelling of the first and last name as it appears in talks returns oh my  got your first name as joanne smith is that correct yeah I have your date of birth as january 26  1967 yes and miss I will be a good email address for you to receive your digital insurance cards um  it is j smith gmail.com perfect and miss you are a united state citizen is that correct yes perfect  and miss every company runs a background check to authenticate or US citizenship it's going to  be tied into your social security go ahead with this social um this is just going to be fake or I  don't let it go like I can just give you just a fake one it'll let it go of course of course don't  give me your real one yeah I'm not going to give you my real one but I just do one just stay like  111 111 yeah I was going to say 123456789 yeah okay yeah um and then obviously this social security you  want to make sure that you sound confident is to verify that they are our real person um and then  miss what would be a good street address put in all their information for address um to continue  this script guys it's kind of uh use it as they as a rubric you don't have you don't have to um  because it's a little different with the script versus how it's done with  the application use it as a as a good rubric um when you come when when you come in terms to  upset and whatnot and how to pitch the policy but you don't have to read a word by word  everybody's got their own way of speaking and you want to make this kind of a natural so  you don't have to read a word by word um so from there I'm going to run into some issues because  I've been into a school show but let's see if all we go here you put the phone number  you want to click on send paper notices in the mail so they can receive their physical insurance  cards it's going to sync with the marketplace always do you want to see if you're eligible for  call savings guys these questions you don't have to ask you just say yes that's just see that's  you grant her for subsidies um here you already asked this question at the beginning of  of the pitch um when they had Medicare, Medicaid, EPA, drug care or any other health coverage  if you just follow the script you won't have to ask it again um but if you want to play the  safe just ask twice that then are you married answer yes I would type in all the information  just for the sake of time I missed my past that just for the past time no  Mr. Curly spoke any cigarettes as of right now no perfect and miss are you currently incarcerated  detained or in jail of course no perfect and miss are you a Alaska native or an American Indian  no perfect and these questions are optional skip them  it's optional you skip them um if you get this question is joined a naturalizer  derived citizen nine out of ten times it's because the social is wrong or you missed  something about her first or last name or the bigger something is wrong with how you type the  information um so double verify and go back if you see this make sure that the social is right  or what not um and then continue um and once you actually come to the enrollment portion you're  going to want to check the NPN override sheet once more and make sure that you see the you're  going to see the name of the actual uh AOR agent on record and it's very important that you see the  AOR with the same care so if you're going to write this blue crossbridge field uh policy within  the state of Texas you can write under both kialas or amy's name just make sure that you see  either amy's or kialas name huh um it'll happen automatically I can't do it because I gave  a wrong social um and then it'll pop up there though and we'll just uh click it  it'll pop up automatically right we just click it yeah you just click it cool and then before  you actually complete the application this is crucial um all of this is uh you can kind of  it's important that you ask these questions don't get me wrong um but you can kind of do it in  your own manner this verification script this is the consent portion so once you're about to  enroll them to the policy what where it says enroll or click this button and it's a finalized  station of the policy to get them enrolled you're going to want to read this script off um from A to  A so uh miss my name's Nicholas I'm going to be I'm with EHG today uh today's date is  October 31st of 2025 uh can you please state your full name and date of birth with consent  journal and in the marketplace don't Smith January 26th 1967 perfect and miss I'm just going to read  some disclosures please wait

them dental see if you can pitch them um vision um see if you can pitch in critical illness  critical illness the way i pitch them is to kind of talk bad about the policy deductible once  they're enrolled and say hey this is out of pocket maybe too expensive let's see if we can get to a  a uh critical illness portion that will give you immediate coverage i got a bit of something  what happened to you so let me pull this up and you guys are going to receive this  after the meeting we're going to post it for everybody it's going to be through past day  while my computer is focused on my tabs um you're going to get to this page we're going to  click on quote in a rule um yeah hey how do we get the next that page we're gonna we're gonna  send you the credentials to log in yeah yes uh nika have a question yeah yeah go ahead  if most of these people are wanting zero dollar premiums um what percentage of them are going  to pay extra for critical illness or dental one out of seven one out of eight okay dental vision  or critical illness yeah um more than anything it's going to be your your dental  looking for them okay but if you sell critical illness now when i show you you'll get a hundred  percent of the commissions i just i'm gonna change the commissions um for critical illness for a hundred  percent um and the critical illnesses can be up to eighty a hundred dollars um thank you sweet man thank you  oh yeah so tell me something it's a critical illness kind of like a hospital indemnity or  you know what's what's the deal with critical illness uh like a max your max out of pocket  like oh i see a max out of pocket it's nine thousand dollars you know in any case something happens  you like this it there is a surgery that costs like fifty grand and you're responsible for nine  how you know how how would you like to get some something that's like a gap that that fills  that gap for you for a couple of dollars a month as i sound you know somewhere somewhere around that  i'm sorry about my microphone i took it away from my mouth but what exactly is the critical illness  um because i've never sold it like hospital indemnity yeah you know it's a pretty similar it's  like uh so imagine you get you get a person enrolled into a zero dollar plan but they're deductible  is four thousand five thousand dollars um a hospital indemnity plan maybe they just want to  you know um pick up uh speak to a certain specialist and that specialist uh let them see that  you have to pay the deductible price you see the specialist um so you pitch the policy to say hey  listen this policy that we enrolled you in it's a great policy in case god forbid something  where it happened to you in the meantime if you do need to see your doctor repeatedly i would  recommend we add you a hospital indemnity policy um at xyz cost through all state um it's going to  come in at eighty dollars and that's going to cover your your co-pays moving forward or if it's a  critical illness you say hey this policy it's going to be uh you have a eight thousand dollar deductible  in case of of you having a god forbid a heart attack or a critical illness by this policy itself  it's going to cover you and grant you fifty thousand dollars um if something works your god forbid a  curve on this route incur an added safety net to the policy that you currently have and then  use the update if they buy if they want to proceed or not a lot of the times what for the critical  illness it's if you're pitching people that are accustomed to paying a lot of money for their  insurance and they don't realize it so if you got if if um anybody that comes from not selling  zero dollar plans but others for the policies that cost over a hundred two hundred dollars  if you hitch a policy that's too low a little cost they get suspicious so the critical illness  can be added to kind of dissuade them from this tradition they're they're just not too informed  of how subsidies work or what um so if they're accustomed to paying two hundred dollars yeah they're  accustomed to paying two hundred dollars they think because it's two hundred dollars it's a better  time than a hundred dollars you know what wrong with this saying it's zero man what's going on  yeah yeah i know i know they think it's a scam so might as well um get them on better policy  and with the critical illness benefit you know uh fifty thousand dollar across the board  i'm going to show you i'm gonna show you i'm gonna show you i'm gonna show you i'm gonna show you  it's per event incident right i mean yeah it's pretty cool i mean i mean i did i did hospital  demities but yeah so and this which will quick do marketplace transfer we're not having to do  that are we just think guarantee that we're not going to do that what that there's an 80% chance of  we're not going to do it and that's awesome and the hourly people get the full commission on the  critical illness that's a change no sir no sir they're separate commissions  so are we getting a hundred percent of the commission on hospital and demnied as well  only critical illness uh are they differing or are you also i'll tell you let me show you a little  poll here you got it um Nick do you want me to just come on slack on Monday morning and see what you  can do to help me i'll keep you posted yeah okay so here's your once you're on the page uh you're  just gonna go here quote on a roll put the effective date put today's date you want to charge  in that same day make sure that the court goes through so let's say it's 10th they're first  2025 um they're based on three three zero zero nine date of birth of June 18th six seven seven  mail yeah i can't wait to get in some of this uh we'll do well with answer all right  right just click in the little calendar and picking today that might clear it  and i also saw the head life insurance as well we even saw life insurance i saw that in that video  150,000 dollar policy um yes it would be  burn life wait so you'll pay us a hundred percent on that too for commission people uh yes  that's great man thank you sir no worries it's  well i'm sorry i'm stupid my bad um really it's 150 yeah they said it only works if you make it effective  tomorrow but i guess they didn't specify about weekends or at least available i don't know  always that little calendar on the left one there we go there we go i don't know why um okay i just  put the early date no worries um so i mean it's not gonna happen let's just do photo  something they're all the same policy within the whole country um you type in all their name you  probably already have that because you close them with all um skip that uh that should provide and  then you would just click on the options here so if you wanted to pitch for term medical i wouldn't  worry too much about your term medical i would just focus on dental dental fixed and dental accident  um cancer and heart stroke i would just worry about dental accident cancer  yeah you'll see all the options here and then you're just  asked or don't worry about that  let me see put a different answer  so wait you just have to enter their information once and you can see all the different types of  things they could get just like clicking those arrows down the left  putting on shame that is sweet i'm used to having to retive everything  there we go there we go it's like user friendly it's user friendly so yeah you'll have the dental  options the i would only worry about dental um cancer heart stroke but term lies  can we get it he showed that yesterday term life yep you could do term life um the dental  envision it's kind of weird you're gonna have to add a twelve dollar you're gonna have to click  add and you're gonna have to add a separate um product that's gonna be twelve dollar minimum  32 purchase it's weird how it works so if you get them up all through and you pitch it as a 59  dollar dental um mention hey we can get you a $43 dental it's gonna also include um separate  coverage for critical onalist um at $13.50 one sentence we're gonna have works but you have all  these options i would just pitch and dental critical on this if they're looking for more coverage  because maybe they're not happy with the deductible whatever it may be um this is a perfect candidate  pitch this product user people complaining about the deductibles um dental as if they want dental  these are the dental plans just so you know they're through uh at none they're under the network  of at best you can pitch them as at policies okay and so that critical illness that's gonna be  11 times 12 that we have paid or just the first premiums it's it's the monthly premium so for  the dental if you pitch them a 54 dollar plan it's gonna be 100% of the of the 54 dollars and 95  that's okay so yes and that's gonna be for term life cancer and all that just uh um yeah i  so dental um accident i wouldn't worry too much about um i would worry about dental cancer and  heart stroke these are phenomenal plans um yeah they're really good plans um you can add  the issues you can you have limits of how much you can add with cancer limits so you can  supplement it with term you can kind of bundle like yeah but i would bundle like cancer and heart  stroke with AD&D so accidental death and dismemberment yeah yeah i forgot what Paul said the the  dental covers um yep so your dental is gonna cover your or it's gonna cover two um white  cleanings a year your checkups um and root canal extractions dentures um i'm gonna cover everything  um don't do anything i yeah it's gonna cover except implants no except implants um yeah  got it that is awesome yeah there's no waiting period um with these dental plans you know how to make  you wait 12 months no waiting periods or yeah what about dentures no dentures  yeah and so the dental plans are with all state  etna etna think dental or etna etna okay i'm sorry i know it's not all state that's  no it's a little confusing because all states are father company yeah it's a little confusing  just think of dental etna anything that's that's what you can put it as you can put it as all state  later yeah i'm the one i said i'll say okay thanks yeah no worries all right team  uh so dental so obviously dental is pretty self-explanatory critical illness um cancer and heart stroke  um these options would classify as critical illness coverage okay i see what you're saying okay  thank you no worries when will it's recording be posted and select immediately i'm gonna  start yeah okay so we get a login for the all state as well yes that's gonna be posted  i'm gonna post that later after this meeting um and then one last thing before let you guys go  um obviously if you do the marketplace transfer follow this um if it comes down to it i don't  think it's gonna come down to it but if it does you have this to follow but at the end of the  call once you enroll them into medical dental vision after you've done with the client  follow the closing statements do you have any questions on what we cover today  okay if any questions come up or you need assistance you can reach us at xyz number  your health policy will take effect come to the first of january state for all of the  carriers that we're selling they're all gonna start on the first of january that's every  single plan um so just stay january first you keep it simple um but you said if they need coverage  for December we could do well somebody said we could do a second one still using those npn  overrides we could do for December if they need that as well all AC still for health insurance  for aca all of the plans are going to be in effect the first of january that's for every agency  every azn is less but for for for these options for instillery products uh i would get them  in effect immediately i would charge them that same day um so i think she's talking about an  scp for um right if they had an npn needed coverage for consent or somebody said we could probably do  scp won't even apply because you're in open enrollment  no no for December they wouldn't need an scp if they need coverage  oh oh oh no

consent portion  you're going to have to ask for consent please uh for just to be extra extra for um i don't think  it's going to happen because we're extremely extremely safe um but for everybody's
