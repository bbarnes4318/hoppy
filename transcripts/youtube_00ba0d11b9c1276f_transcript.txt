=== FULL TRANSCRIPT WITH TIMESTAMPS ===

[00:00 - 00:06] Welcome back to Final Extense Teller Sales. My name is Dana Neeson and today is chapter 4,
[00:06 - 00:14] video 4, number 4 of our 10 part sales series on mastering the sales process. We've covered
[00:14 - 00:20] the opener and objection handling in the first 30 seconds. We've covered discovery and we covered
[00:20 - 00:27] credibility and education. Today is all about finding the need and the need is not I need life
[00:27 - 00:33] insurance, the need is how much coverage do you need. This is a really, really, really
[00:33 - 00:40] important part because we are not order takers. We do not quote people 25,000 just because
[00:40 - 00:47] they asked for 25,000. The theme of today's video is it is not our job to give people
[00:47 - 00:53] what they ask for. It's our job to guide them to what they need. So stick around. We're
[00:53 - 00:58] going to help change your mindset on how to find the need for our final expense clients.
[01:09 - 01:12] If you are just now finding this channel, welcome. Thank you for being here. Again,
[01:12 - 01:18] my name is Dana. I am the owner of Empower Life Group. We are a remote tele-sales agency
[01:18 - 01:23] specializing in simplified issue life. My job is to help you have stronger, more sophisticated
[01:23 - 01:29] sales conversations. And we are growing. If you are looking for a home, if you're looking for a team,
[01:29 - 01:33] and you want to learn more about Empower Life Group, all of my contact information is in the
[01:33 - 01:39] description below of every video. We do group opportunity calls every Tuesday and Thursday
[01:39 - 01:44] and I look forward to speaking with you. All right, let's talk about finding the need.
[01:45 - 01:50] All right, we're back to looking at the script behind me. And if you've been tracking so far,
[01:50 - 01:56] we've overcome objections. We've gone through discovery for the most part, unless we have a type
[01:56 - 02:00] Bay personality and if we have a type A personality then way be we're in
[02:00 - 02:03] discovery now right because we've gone through credibility and education to
[02:03 - 02:07] lower walls then we're circling back to discovery and then we're finding our
[02:07 - 02:13] way to uncovering the need and remember the need is not I need life insurance I
[02:13 - 02:17] need to protect my family the need is how much coverage is appropriate for them
[02:17 - 02:24] and this is where we are going to try to help set expectations we do try to set
[02:24 - 02:29] expectations in education right by helping them understand that if they want the big
[02:29 - 02:34] amount of coverage that they said they wanted then maybe whole life is not going to be the
[02:34 - 02:39] best option because it's more expensive and are you open to looking at a smaller amount right but
[02:39 - 02:47] when we go to uncovering the need we have gone through education and up here we say so okay so now
[02:47 - 02:51] that we understand what type of insurance we're looking for right we're looking for whole life
[02:51 - 02:56] insurance, something that's never going to go up in price or cancel, and we know what
[02:56 - 03:01] we wanted to take care of, right? So we want to make sure we take care of a cremation.
[03:01 - 03:05] The next step would be to try to figure out how much coverage you might need for that.
[03:05 - 03:09] So we're not over-insuring you, we're not taking food off the table, and we're coming
[03:09 - 03:15] up with a reasonable payment that you can make every single month without having to stress.
[03:15 - 03:20] Now have you ever had to plan or pay for a funeral before?
[03:20 - 03:27] I'm asking that because I need to gauge if they have any experience in how much it costs
[03:27 - 03:33] as well as trying to get them to open up to me about what that experience was like for
[03:33 - 03:35] them and the family that had to go through it.
[03:35 - 03:40] So you have some follow-up questions there, but your follow-up questions will also dictate
[03:40 - 03:45] the answer that you get, right, when you ask the question, have you ever had to plan
[03:45 - 03:46] or pay for a funeral before?
[03:46 - 03:49] What was that experience like?
[03:49 - 03:52] did they have life insurance? What did the family have to do? Did they have to
[03:52 - 03:57] come together, right? So I'm talking about all of that. But then I have an agent
[03:57 - 04:01] note here. This is your opportunity to help place your prospect at the funeral
[04:01 - 04:04] home. Get them to picture. It will be like for their loved ones when they pass,
[04:04 - 04:08] allow them to share a story, ask clarifying questions, such as tell me more about
[04:08 - 04:13] that. What type of impact did that have on you? Remember change only takes place
[04:13 - 04:20] when emotion creates urgency. Now, earlier, you shared with me that you wanted to have a
[04:20 - 04:25] traditional burial or direct cremation. Do you have any idea how much that's costing in your area?
[04:26 - 04:31] Now, if they have experience, I don't want to argue with them, right? If they say yes,
[04:31 - 04:39] we just buried my brother, son, sister, uncle last month and it cost our family $25,000.
[04:39 - 04:43] Well, I'm not going to say, well, that's not how much it cost, right?
[04:43 - 04:46] Because all that's going to do is lose credibility.
[04:46 - 04:51] I also may not leverage funeralosity, which is what we're going to talk about here in
[04:51 - 04:56] a second to look up the prices in the area, because if that's the same funeral home they
[04:56 - 05:01] want to use and that's how much they charge, then they know how much they need.
[05:01 - 05:07] Now I might say, well, are you wanting to go to that same funeral home?
[05:07 - 05:13] you tied? Do you have a plot there? Is that what your family does? Are you open to maybe exploring
[05:13 - 05:21] other local funeral homes in the area that maybe don't charge $25,000 for a funeral? That could be an
[05:21 - 05:30] opening for me then to bridge into. Well, if it helps, I have access to a database that gives me
[05:30 - 05:36] up-to-date pricing by city, state, and even zip code and I can compare funeral homes in the area
[05:36 - 05:40] to help you give, to help give you an idea of what they're currently charging.
[05:40 - 05:46] Would you like me to look that up for you? Again, I'm asking permission to give the client a
[05:46 - 05:53] perception of control and that they have a say in the direction of the conversation. I never say
[05:53 - 05:58] which agents do all the time. I never say, well, let me just look that up for you and I'll tell you
[05:58 - 06:04] what it is. Well, that's too aggressive, too aggressive and you're going to unknowingly cause
[06:04 - 06:09] sales resistance. So if they already have a plan, if they already have experience, I'm
[06:09 - 06:14] going to say, well, are you tied to that place? Are you open to looking at other ones? Would
[06:14 - 06:22] you like me to help you so that I can go over maybe other options that aren't as expensive?
[06:22 - 06:27] And if they say yes, then I'm going to click on this link right here, Funeralacity. I'm
[06:27 - 06:31] going to type in their zip code and it's going to give me a list of Funeral homes in their
[06:31 - 06:35] area that I can name drop to give me some credibility, and it'll give me a
[06:35 - 06:42] breakdown of everything that's included in a full-service burial, just a regular
[06:42 - 06:46] burial, a full-service cremation and a direct cremation, and I can help guide
[06:46 - 06:51] them towards maybe other options that aren't so expensive so that I can get
[06:51 - 06:55] them a reasonable amount of coverage that they can afford. Because remember you
[06:55 - 07:00] have to remember that our clients are avatars. They are living on a fixed
[07:00 - 07:06] income and I have to get them something that they can afford first and foremost and I
[07:06 - 07:10] also have to make them feel good about the amount of coverage that they're putting in place,
[07:10 - 07:13] so I don't walk into a that's not enough coverage objection.
[07:13 - 07:19] So all of these things are going through my mind as I'm walking them down the path into
[07:19 - 07:23] changing their situation and buying a policy.
[07:23 - 07:29] Now most of the time you'll find that they just say 25,000 because they're seeing ads
[07:29 - 07:35] that say 25,000. They actually have no idea how much it costs. They have not only do they not have
[07:35 - 07:40] any idea how much it costs to have a cremation or a burial, they have no idea how much it costs
[07:40 - 07:48] for 25,000 in life insurance. But you do. And you know someone who's 75 with COPD or diabetic
[07:48 - 07:55] neuropathy likely is not going to be able to afford 25,000 in whole life coverage. So don't quote them
[07:55 - 08:05] that find ways to talk them off the ledge instead so that they feel good about maybe 5,000
[08:05 - 08:08] or 8,000 or 10,000 or 12,000, right?
[08:08 - 08:13] Anything other than 25 unless you have someone in their 50s and perfect health that can
[08:13 - 08:16] likely afford it.
[08:16 - 08:21] So I'm having this conversation with them and I'm getting them to agree with me on how
[08:21 - 08:24] much coverage would be appropriate to look at.
[08:24 - 08:27] So if they started 25, and I'm looking, I'm name dropping funeral homes, and I'm saying,
[08:27 - 08:34] you know, even the most expensive funeral home in this area is right around 10 to 15,000
[08:34 - 08:35] or for cremation.
[08:35 - 08:42] You know, right around 3 to 5,000, maybe 8,000 at the most for a full viewing and service
[08:42 - 08:44] prior to the cremation.
[08:44 - 08:50] I know you said that you were maybe looking for 25,000, but really my goal is to make sure
[08:50 - 08:55] we find something that's affordable and my guess is that 25,000 will probably be
[08:55 - 09:00] unaffordable. So if we can at least cover the immediate expenses make sure that
[09:00 - 09:05] nobody has to come out of pocket and pay for your cremation, your burial, whatever
[09:05 - 09:12] it is, would that be a terrible idea? Or do you trust me to help put your family
[09:12 - 09:17] in the best position? So I'm getting them to pre-agree to what I think they
[09:17 - 09:23] need, not what they want. That is the goal of this section to find the need, to
[09:23 - 09:27] typically we're going to talk them down on how much coverage they said they
[09:27 - 09:33] wanted, and then that moves us into underwriting, which will be the next video.
[09:33 - 09:39] And so this video is pretty short, but it's so important. I just had a call
[09:39 - 09:46] with an agent yesterday who the woman asked, you know, was asking for 25,000
[09:46 - 09:51] this exact scenario, and they somehow came to find out that the budget was somewhere
[09:51 - 09:58] between $40 and $60, and $40 to $60 was not going to buy her $25,000, but the agent
[09:58 - 10:03] was so focused on the $25,000 that he didn't even pay attention really to the budget.
[10:03 - 10:09] And the lowest quote that he gave her, which he called the starter plan, was a $12,000
[10:09 - 10:12] policy for $68 a month, I think is what it was.
[10:12 - 10:18] And then he went up to 88 and then he went up to over $100 a month and then she started
[10:18 - 10:22] waffling and the call ended.
[10:22 - 10:30] So if we pay more attention to budget, to price, my mental range of pricing for policies
[10:30 - 10:36] that typically stay on the books the longest is somewhere between 60 and 80.
[10:36 - 10:38] That's like the sweet spot for final expense.
[10:38 - 10:41] Sure you will have policies that will be higher than that.
[10:41 - 10:46] And that's good for the pocketbook, that's good for the leaderboards, but it's not necessarily
[10:46 - 10:51] the best for long-term stability in your business and growing your book of business.
[10:51 - 10:56] I would much rather have someone get something that they know they can afford today and have
[10:56 - 11:01] an opportunity to call them in six months to a year from now and maybe add on additional
[11:01 - 11:06] coverage because they've been stable and made their payments every single month.
[11:06 - 11:14] So always remember that your clients have no idea what they want, sorry, your clients
[11:14 - 11:16] have no idea what they need.
[11:16 - 11:20] They have an idea of what they want based on the ads that they see in the marketing.
[11:20 - 11:26] It's your job to deliver what they need in confidence and guide them towards the most
[11:26 - 11:30] appropriate solution, which is always one that they can afford.
[11:30 - 11:33] So remember, we aren't order takers.
[11:33 - 11:36] We don't always quote people what they say they want.
[11:36 - 11:43] We focus on what they need so that we can help them put their family in a better position.
[11:43 - 11:49] Because at the end of the day, if we sticker shock them with coverage that's unreasonable,
[11:49 - 11:56] if we fail to set good expectations, then we leave them with nothing and the best coverage
[11:56 - 12:01] is not just the coverage they can sign, but it's the coverage that will actually be put
[12:01 - 12:05] in place and pay out to their family when that time comes.
[12:05 - 12:07] Thanks for watching, and I'll see you on lesson five.

Welcome back to Final Extense Teller Sales. My name is Dana Neeson and today is chapter 4,  video 4, number 4 of our 10 part sales series on mastering the sales process.
