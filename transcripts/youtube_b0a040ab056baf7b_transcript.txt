=== FULL TRANSCRIPT WITH TIMESTAMPS ===

[00:00 - 00:05] All right, we've made it today, three of our 10-part series in mastering the sales process,
[00:05 - 00:10] simplified issue life. Welcome back to Final Expense, tell the sales, my name is Dana Neeson.
[00:10 - 00:18] If you have not yet watched part one and part two of this series, stop, go back. We first we cover
[00:18 - 00:25] first 30 seconds and your opener objection handling. Then we talk all about discovery and how to
[00:25 - 00:32] ask hard questions, the differences between how to handle a misbeddie versus a type A personality
[00:32 - 00:38] from New York or New Jersey, and today we are talking about credibility and education.
[00:38 - 00:44] If you've watched the first two videos and we are now meeting for video three, please give this
[00:44 - 00:49] video a like and post a comment and tell me what you've learned so far, what you're changing with
[00:49 - 00:56] your current sales process and anything else that you'd like to share, these do so. It
[00:56 - 01:02] really motivates me to continue to keep putting videos and content out like this knowing that
[01:02 - 01:09] it's really making a difference in the way that you present to our clients. So welcome back
[01:09 - 01:25] to day three. If you are just now finding this channel, let me welcome you. Again, my name is Dana
[01:25 - 01:30] and I'm the owner and founder of Empower Life Group. If you're looking for a home, if you're
[01:30 - 01:35] unlicensed and figuring out where to go or if you're really not happy with your current agency,
[01:35 - 01:39] if they're not giving you the help and support and training that you need in order to take your
[01:39 - 01:45] business to the next level, contact me. All of my contact information is in the description below.
[01:45 - 01:50] We are bringing on agents and leaders every single day in order to really make a difference in our
[01:50 - 01:56] space. So just to remind you where we left off at the end of discovery, we had ended with the
[01:56 - 02:03] consequence question followed by a check-in statement. So if we could lock in this piece of mind for
[02:03 - 02:07] you today, assuming we can find something comfortable and affordable, how would that feel to know
[02:07 - 02:14] that it's finally taken care of, right? And that's where we had ended with our discovery and we are
[02:14 - 02:21] bridging now into credibility. Well, it's really, I'm really happy to hear you say that. Again,
[02:21 - 02:27] my name is Dana Neeson and the State Department of Insurance. They do require that I provide you with
[02:27 - 02:33] my national producer number, which you can also use to verify my credentials visiting the Department
[02:33 - 02:39] of Insurance. Do you have a pen and paper to write it down? I like the act of them writing it down
[02:39 - 02:42] because then they're more engaged and they're more checked in.
[02:43 - 02:48] While they're doing that, I say, now while you get that, I'm also going to text you a copy of my
[02:48 - 02:54] business card so you know exactly how to reach me. And on that card, it'll have my picture on it,
[02:54 - 03:00] my national producer number, my email address, all the different ways that you can reach me.
[03:00 - 03:05] In fact, why don't you put me on speakerphone and let me know when that card comes through.
[03:05 - 03:13] This is also helpful to do because of what I'm also gauging is how good are they at putting me on
[03:13 - 03:21] speakerphone and accessing a text message at the same time and also replying back to the text message
[03:21 - 03:30] so that I'm kind of judging their skills and their ability so that when I get to the end and I'm going to give them options of carriers.
[03:30 - 03:36] Well, I definitely don't want to pick one like mutual vomahop, for example, that's very
[03:36 - 03:41] text heavy with pop-up blockers and a lot of people have trouble there if they're not
[03:41 - 03:44] really good with their phone to begin with.
[03:44 - 03:48] So we want to, the best carrier, you want to remember that the best carrier is the one
[03:48 - 03:51] that your clients can sign.
[03:51 - 03:56] And if they are already having challenges getting your business card, putting you on speaker,
[03:56 - 04:03] at it and replying to it, you're probably going to need to pivot to either email or voice signature.
[04:03 - 04:08] Okay, so these are little clues. So I do ask them to put me on speakerphone, look at the card,
[04:08 - 04:14] click on the picture, make it bigger. Do you see me? You know, I'm so glad to meet you. Hey,
[04:14 - 04:20] do me a favor and reply, got it or yes or something so that I know that it came through okay.
[04:21 - 04:26] And I actually have them go through that process. You could even take it one step further and have
[04:26 - 04:32] them save you as a contact on your phone. So that way the next time you call, you're right to
[04:32 - 04:37] follow up or whatever you need, you're already in there. Then I transition to kind of letting
[04:37 - 04:44] them know what my job is. And I do this, if you're paying attention, I do this after discovery,
[04:44 - 04:49] right? Because I'm trying really hard to not make this call about me. I'm trying to keep all of
[04:49 - 04:55] the attention on them, maybe share a story or two. And then what's walls are lowered and I understand
[04:55 - 05:01] with the need is, then I now feel appropriate to kind of talk about my role in this and how I could help.
[05:02 - 05:09] So my job as a licensed broker in the state of insert their state, California, is to shop around with
[05:09 - 05:16] all 26 major carriers to find who will offer you the best rate and the most coverage based on your
[05:16 - 05:23] age and your health. Now this way, you won't have to worry about picking up the phone and calling
[05:23 - 05:28] all of them yourself. Do you like the idea of that? I had to kind of like double down here. Yeah,
[05:28 - 05:33] I really like that. Good because how frustrating would it be to have to like make all the phone
[05:33 - 05:38] calls and talk to so many different people and then you get more confused and you don't know who to
[05:38 - 05:44] go with. Like, that's my job. I can do all the shopping for you and you only need to talk to one
[05:44 - 05:53] person. What objection am I trying to prevent in the credibility section? I'm trying to prevent
[05:53 - 05:58] I want to shop around, right? I want to call around. Everything that I do here is very intentional.
[06:00 - 06:07] Now, most people that I work with are on a fixed income, right? Like social security or disability,
[06:07 - 06:13] are you on a fixed income? Yes, we want to relate that to people that we work with. So it's very
[06:13 - 06:18] important that we find something comfortable and affordable. We're not looking to take food off
[06:18 - 06:24] the table. We want to make sure you have money for gifts and holidays and all the fun stuff.
[06:24 - 06:28] But at the same time, we want to make sure that we also protect your family.
[06:29 - 06:34] Because that sound like something you're looking for. Good. Now does the money that you collect
[06:34 - 06:40] from Social Security? Does that get directly deposited into a bank account or a credit union?
[06:40 - 06:44] Or do you get the money directly on one of those green direct express cards?
[06:44 - 06:53] Okay, now in my script I have an agent note that says some carriers don't accept cards or direct express cards.
[06:53 - 07:01] But also the reason that they don't is because direct express cards tend to have a lower persistency overall.
[07:01 - 07:08] It's riskier business. Usually people who can only get paid on the director's but direct express card aren't doing that by choice.
[07:08 - 07:18] Typically it's because they can't get a big account because they've made four financial decisions that have put them in this position in the first place.
[07:18 - 07:29] So me personally, it's a judgment call. I typically tell people with only direct express cards that I'm not sure I'll be able to help them.
[07:29 - 07:36] Especially like this happened this morning, we were doing live dials and the woman said that she had applied for a policy
[07:36 - 07:43] But the first payment never went through and we came to find out that the payment was like $20 a month for a
[07:43 - 07:53] $5,000 policy and she had a direct express card. Well, I was telling the agent like this is probably going to be a waste of your time because the same thing is going to happen to you
[07:54 - 07:55] $20 a
[07:55 - 07:58] a $20 a month policy on a direct express card.
[07:58 - 07:59] That's like a double whammy.
[07:59 - 08:01] And she already hasn't made her first payment
[08:01 - 08:03] on a policy she's already applied for.
[08:03 - 08:06] Like you just need to know when to walk away
[08:06 - 08:11] and value your time more than trying to get an application
[08:11 - 08:14] or squeezing the living life out of every single lead
[08:14 - 08:15] that you get.
[08:15 - 08:17] Okay, good lesson.
[08:18 - 08:20] So here I'm trying to determine at this point,
[08:20 - 08:23] do I want to stay on the phone with this client?
[08:23 - 08:25] Are they worth my time?
[08:25 - 08:28] right, because we've already gone through the hard stuff.
[08:28 - 08:32] And if they qualify, then we continue.
[08:32 - 08:36] And now I'm bridging into education.
[08:36 - 08:38] Now, before we get into the health questions
[08:38 - 08:41] and figure out what you could possibly qualify for,
[08:41 - 08:44] it's important to understand what type of policy
[08:44 - 08:46] we're gonna be looking at.
[08:46 - 08:49] Now, has anyone ever taken the time
[08:49 - 08:52] to explain the difference between term insurance
[08:52 - 08:55] and whole life insurance to you before?
[08:55 - 08:58] Hey, there's two different ways that you can go here.
[08:58 - 09:01] If they say no, I'm making a big deal out of it,
[09:01 - 09:04] especially if they've been shopping for a while,
[09:04 - 09:07] and I'm going to start creating a lot of doubt
[09:07 - 09:10] between the people that they've spoken with before
[09:10 - 09:14] spoken with before and me, really.
[09:14 - 09:17] Wow, so you've been shopping around for a few weeks
[09:17 - 09:20] and nobody has taken the time to help you understand this.
[09:20 - 09:23] Wow, I mean, it's kind of a big deal
[09:23 - 09:28] because if you don't understand what type of policy someone's trying to get for you,
[09:28 - 09:31] gosh, you might accidentally buy something that's going to cancel.
[09:31 - 09:35] And then your kids are left with nothing and you've spent all this money.
[09:35 - 09:39] So let's not make that mistake and make sure that you understand it.
[09:39 - 09:43] So you are getting yourself into a policy that sticks forever.
[09:43 - 09:50] Deal? Yes. Okay. So I kind of get them engaged and interested and very curious
[09:50 - 09:54] about learning, about what type of policy is appropriate for them.
[09:54 - 10:01] Now, if they do know the difference, I want to know their level of understanding.
[10:01 - 10:03] And so I'll say something like, that's amazing.
[10:03 - 10:06] You're like 10 steps ahead of most people.
[10:06 - 10:11] Now just to make sure we're on the same page, can you tell me your understanding on the
[10:11 - 10:13] difference between the two?
[10:13 - 10:22] I'd probably venture to say that eight times out of 10, they know maybe 25 to 40% of what they
[10:22 - 10:28] actually should know. And honestly, sometimes people have said term-built cash value and whole
[10:28 - 10:34] life is just life insurance. Like they really don't really know. So make them feel good about
[10:34 - 10:40] the information that they've given you and congratulate them. Again, you know what, you're like
[10:40 - 10:47] 80% of the way there, is it okay if I fill in some of the gaps? And if you notice, I'm always
[10:47 - 10:54] strategically asking permission to continue because when you ask permission to continue with the
[10:54 - 11:02] next step, what you're actually doing is giving your prospect a perceived, a perception of control,
[11:02 - 11:08] right? When they dictate whether or not you can go this way or this way, they feel like they have
[11:08 - 11:14] some sort of control or say in how this conversation is going to happen as opposed to well,
[11:14 - 11:19] let me tell you what it is or actually I'll just tell you, you know, I'll just fill in the gaps
[11:19 - 11:25] for you and then you just talk. So take a moment, take a step back, remember to ask permission
[11:26 - 11:34] as often as you can before you just shove information down someone's throat. Okay, so now you have
[11:34 - 11:40] a path for if they say no, you have a path for if they say yes, either way you're still giving them
[11:40 - 11:49] the same information. The goal of education is to not make sure they know that whole life
[11:49 - 11:57] insurance is permanent and term insurance cancels. That's one goal, but it's not the main goal.
[11:57 - 12:04] The main goal of education is to make sure they understand that term insurance is cheap
[12:05 - 12:11] and it gives you a lot more coverage and you may not qualify for it depending on your your health.
[12:11 - 12:16] Now we also want to stay neutral because if you're on the phone with someone who's young enough
[12:16 - 12:22] and healthy enough and has a lot more than just final expenses to cover, well maybe there's room
[12:22 - 12:26] term for term and whole life in this conversation, right?
[12:26 - 12:28] So you want to try to stay neutral.
[12:28 - 12:34] You don't want to kind of bash on term insurance if you're talking to someone who only qualifies
[12:34 - 12:39] for whole life, but you want to give them the information in a way where they feel empowered
[12:39 - 12:42] to make the decision themselves.
[12:42 - 12:47] So what I have written down as an example is the best way I can explain it to you is
[12:47 - 12:52] term insurance is temporary protection, which means it only lasts for a certain amount
[12:52 - 12:57] of years, and then it cancels. And then you pause, right?
[12:57 - 13:05] Posing between, between important sentences provides room for your prospect to
[13:05 - 13:10] absorb what you just said, and maybe ask a question or provide a
[13:10 - 13:15] statement before you move on. Way too many agents say that sentence
[13:15 - 13:19] and without even taking a breath, they keep talking. Okay, don't make that mistake.
[13:19 - 13:21] The second sentence says,
[13:21 - 13:24] Term insurance also provides a higher amount of coverage
[13:24 - 13:28] for a smaller monthly payment to protect things like,
[13:28 - 13:30] maybe a mortgage,
[13:30 - 13:34] or maybe you need income replacement when raising a family.
[13:34 - 13:40] It usually covers much, much larger expenses
[13:40 - 13:43] that aren't going to be there forever, that you could outlive.
[13:43 - 13:46] Plus, with term insurance,
[13:46 - 13:49] sometimes the price can even go up over time
[13:49 - 13:55] over time, maybe every five years, which can make it unaffordable. Does that make sense?
[13:56 - 14:02] So even the longest term insurance policies, they typically cancel by the age of 80,
[14:03 - 14:10] and then your family's left with nothing. Pause. Let them process everything you just said
[14:11 - 14:17] and make sure they got it, right? Does that make sense? Do you have any questions about what I just said?
[14:17 - 14:24] So, do you see why maybe term insurance may not be the best option for you if you're
[14:24 - 14:28] looking to cover final expenses like a burial or cremation?
[14:28 - 14:30] And why do you agree with me about that?
[14:30 - 14:34] I'm doubling down here because I want them to repeat back to me, which will ingrain
[14:34 - 14:41] in their brain, that they understand what I just said, and it cements it.
[14:41 - 14:44] Well, I wouldn't want that because, you know, I don't want to have to take the chance
[14:44 - 14:49] about living something, and then the last few questions, like, what happens to all the money that you just paid?
[14:49 - 14:52] Well, it would go away.
[14:52 - 14:55] Then we move into whole life.
[14:55 - 14:59] Now, whole life insurance is the exact opposite.
[14:59 - 15:02] Once you're approved, the payment can never go up.
[15:02 - 15:07] Your coverage can never go down, and it can never be canceled at any age.
[15:07 - 15:11] These are the types of policies that people get to make sure things like their funeral costs
[15:11 - 15:18] and final expenses are taken care of because it's permanent. Does that make sense, right? And
[15:20 - 15:26] depending, here's the tricky part about education that you can't script. Depending on the information
[15:26 - 15:32] you got in discovery, this is where you tie things in. So if in discovery, someone had said
[15:33 - 15:40] that they saw an ad for, you know, $20,000 for $999 a month, I'm going to bring that information back
[15:40 - 15:46] in in education when I talk about term. Now, you told me earlier that you saw an ad for
[15:46 - 15:53] 20,000 in coverage for $9.99 a month. More than likely, this is an example of term insurance.
[15:54 - 16:00] More than likely, that's a teaser rate. The price would keep going up, but ultimately, it would
[16:00 - 16:05] cancel. And if you got a proof for it, you would likely outlive it. Does that make sense?
[16:05 - 16:15] If he had said something like, I want to cover, you know, a funeral, leave 50,000 for my wife,
[16:15 - 16:20] leave 50,000 for my kids, and they have these unrealistic expectations about what they can get
[16:20 - 16:26] at their age, I bring that back into education. Maybe when I talk about permanent insurance,
[16:26 - 16:31] now you told me earlier that you were really hoping to get this much for the funeral,
[16:31 - 16:37] this much for your wife, this much for your kids, I have to share that that might be an unreasonable
[16:37 - 16:42] amount of coverage for us to look at if you're wanting something that's never going to cancel.
[16:42 - 16:50] Those policies are much more expensive. So are you open to us just starting to look at the
[16:50 - 16:57] final expenses? First, see if that's affordable, see if we can maintain that, and then maybe look at
[16:57 - 17:01] the cost of adding additional coverage to protect your family for whatever else they might need
[17:01 - 17:08] that money for. But likely we're probably not going to go anywhere close to the original
[17:08 - 17:13] coverage amount that you told me today, right? So I have to bring that stuff in. I can't script
[17:13 - 17:18] that because I don't know what they're going to say, but your job as the licensed agent is to pay
[17:18 - 17:24] attention to those clues and bring that information back into the section that it's appropriate,
[17:24 - 17:30] as opposed to handling it right then and there where it doesn't belong. If you want better
[17:30 - 17:35] training like this or more detailed information or call reviews or be involved in a group where
[17:35 - 17:39] we're always talking about this stuff, you'd have to join the team. There's only so much information
[17:39 - 17:44] that I can give in a YouTube video but hopefully that's enough for you to have some aha moments,
[17:44 - 17:50] some light bulb moments and be able to pay more attention to the information your clients are
[17:50 - 17:57] giving you. Now today's video is relatively short. We talk about credibility. We try to cover
[17:57 - 18:02] the I want to shop around objection. We talk about education. We want to make sure they have realistic
[18:02 - 18:08] expectations about how much coverage they could get and the cost. Not just that it's permanent
[18:08 - 18:14] in temporary. And then we move on to part four, which is figuring out how much coverage is
[18:14 - 18:20] appropriate for them based on their needs. And I will see you next time on part four of our 10
[18:20 - 18:23] part series of mastering the sales process.

=== FULL TRANSCRIPT (CONTINUOUS TEXT) ===

All right, we've made it today, three of our 10-part series in mastering the sales process,  simplified issue life. Welcome back to Final Expense, tell the sales, my name is Dana Neeson.  If you have not yet watched part one and part two of this series, stop, go back. We first we cover  first 30 seconds and your opener objection handling. Then we talk all about discovery and how to  ask hard questions, the differences between how to handle a misbeddie versus a type A personality  from New York or New Jersey, and today we are talking about credibility and education.  If you've watched the first two videos and we are now meeting for video three, please give this  video a like and post a comment and tell me what you've learned so far, what you're changing with  your current sales process and anything else that you'd like to share, these do so. It  really motivates me to continue to keep putting videos and content out like this knowing that  it's really making a difference in the way that you present to our clients. So welcome back  to day three. If you are just now finding this channel, let me welcome you. Again, my name is Dana  and I'm the owner and founder of Empower Life Group. If you're looking for a home, if you're  unlicensed and figuring out where to go or if you're really not happy with your current agency,  if they're not giving you the help and support and training that you need in order to take your  business to the next level, contact me. All of my contact information is in the description below.  We are bringing on agents and leaders every single day in order to really make a difference in our  space. So just to remind you where we left off at the end of discovery, we had ended with the  consequence question followed by a check-in statement. So if we could lock in this piece of mind for  you today, assuming we can find something comfortable and affordable, how would that feel to know  that it's finally taken care of, right? And that's where we had ended with our discovery and we are  bridging now into credibility. Well, it's really, I'm really happy to hear you say that. Again,  my name is Dana Neeson and the State Department of Insurance. They do require that I provide you with  my national producer number, which you can also use to verify my credentials visiting the Department  of Insurance. Do you have a pen and paper to write it down? I like the act of them writing it down  because then they're more engaged and they're more checked in.  While they're doing that, I say, now while you get that, I'm also going to text you a copy of my  business card so you know exactly how to reach me. And on that card, it'll have my picture on it,  my national producer number, my email address, all the different ways that you can reach me.  In fact, why don't you put me on speakerphone and let me know when that card comes through.  This is also helpful to do because of what I'm also gauging is how good are they at putting me on  speakerphone and accessing a text message at the same time and also replying back to the text message  so that I'm kind of judging their skills and their ability so that when I get to the end and I'm going to give them options of carriers.  Well, I definitely don't want to pick one like mutual vomahop, for example, that's very  text heavy with pop-up blockers and a lot of people have trouble there if they're not  really good with their phone to begin with.  So we want to, the best carrier, you want to remember that the best carrier is the one  that your clients can sign.  And if they are already having challenges getting your business card, putting you on speaker,  at it and replying to it, you're probably going to need to pivot to either email or voice signature.  Okay, so these are little clues. So I do ask them to put me on speakerphone, look at the card,  click on the picture, make it bigger. Do you see me? You know, I'm so glad to meet you. Hey,  do me a favor and reply, got it or yes or something so that I know that it came through okay.  And I actually have them go through that process. You could even take it one step further and have  them save you as a contact on your phone. So that way the next time you call, you're right to  follow up or whatever you need, you're already in there. Then I transition to kind of letting  them know what my job is. And I do this, if you're paying attention, I do this after discovery,  right? Because I'm trying really hard to not make this call about me. I'm trying to keep all of  the attention on them, maybe share a story or two. And then what's walls are lowered and I understand  with the need is, then I now feel appropriate to kind of talk about my role in this and how I could help.  So my job as a licensed broker in the state of insert their state, California, is to shop around with  all 26 major carriers to find who will offer you the best rate and the most coverage based on your  age and your health. Now this way, you won't have to worry about picking up the phone and calling  all of them yourself. Do you like the idea of that? I had to kind of like double down here. Yeah,  I really like that. Good because how frustrating would it be to have to like make all the phone  calls and talk to so many different people and then you get more confused and you don't know who to  go with. Like, that's my job. I can do all the shopping for you and you only need to talk to one  person. What objection am I trying to prevent in the credibility section? I'm trying to prevent  I want to shop around, right? I want to call around. Everything that I do here is very intentional.  Now, most people that I work with are on a fixed income, right? Like social security or disability,  are you on a fixed income? Yes, we want to relate that to people that we work with. So it's very  important that we find something comfortable and affordable. We're not looking to take food off  the table. We want to make sure you have money for gifts and holidays and all the fun stuff.  But at the same time, we want to make sure that we also protect your family.  Because that sound like something you're looking for. Good. Now does the money that you collect  from Social Security? Does that get directly deposited into a bank account or a credit union?  Or do you get the money directly on one of those green direct express cards?  Okay, now in my script I have an agent note that says some carriers don't accept cards or direct express cards.  But also the reason that they don't is because direct express cards tend to have a lower persistency overall.  It's riskier business. Usually people who can only get paid on the director's but direct express card aren't doing that by choice.  Typically it's because they can't get a big account because they've made four financial decisions that have put them in this position in the first place.  So me personally, it's a judgment call. I typically tell people with only direct express cards that I'm not sure I'll be able to help them.  Especially like this happened this morning, we were doing live dials and the woman said that she had applied for a policy  But the first payment never went through and we came to find out that the payment was like $20 a month for a  $5,000 policy and she had a direct express card. Well, I was telling the agent like this is probably going to be a waste of your time because the same thing is going to happen to you  $20 a  a $20 a month policy on a direct express card.  That's like a double whammy.  And she already hasn't made her first payment  on a policy she's already applied for.  Like you just need to know when to walk away  and value your time more than trying to get an application  or squeezing the living life out of every single lead  that you get.  Okay, good lesson.  So here I'm trying to determine at this point,  do I want to stay on the phone with this client?  Are they worth my time?  right, because we've already gone through the hard stuff.  And if they qualify, then we continue.  And now I'm bridging into education.  Now, before we get into the health questions  and figure out what you could possibly qualify for,  it's important to understand what type of policy  we're gonna be looking at.  Now, has anyone ever taken the time  to explain the difference between term insurance  and whole life insurance to you before?  Hey, there's two different ways that you can go here.  If they say no, I'm making a big deal out of it,  especially if they've been shopping for a while,  and I'm going to start creating a lot of doubt  between the people that they've spoken with before  spoken with before and me, really.  Wow, so you've been shopping around for a few weeks  and nobody has taken the time to help you understand this.  Wow, I mean, it's kind of a big deal  because if you don't understand what type of policy someone's trying to get for you,  gosh, you might accidentally buy something that's going to cancel.  And then your kids are left with nothing and you've spent all this money.  So let's not make that mistake and make sure that you understand it.  So you are getting yourself into a policy that sticks forever.  Deal? Yes. Okay. So I kind of get them engaged and interested and very curious  about learning, about what type of policy is appropriate for them.  Now, if they do know the difference, I want to know their level of understanding.  And so I'll say something like, that's amazing.  You're like 10 steps ahead of most people.  Now just to make sure we're on the same page, can you tell me your understanding on the  difference between the two?  I'd probably venture to say that eight times out of 10, they know maybe 25 to 40% of what they  actually should know. And honestly, sometimes people have said term-built cash value and whole  life is just life insurance. Like they really don't really know. So make them feel good about  the information that they've given you and congratulate them. Again, you know what, you're like  80% of the way there, is it okay if I fill in some of the gaps? And if you notice, I'm always  strategically asking permission to continue because when you ask permission to continue with the  next step, what you're actually doing is giving your prospect a perceived, a perception of control,  right? When they dictate whether or not you can go this way or this way, they feel like they have  some sort of control or say in how this conversation is going to happen as opposed to well,  let me tell you what it is or actually I'll just tell you, you know, I'll just fill in the gaps  for you and then you just talk. So take a moment, take a step back, remember to ask permission  as often as you can before you just shove information down someone's throat. Okay, so now you have  a path for if they say no, you have a path for if they say yes, either way you're still giving them  the same information. The goal of education is to not make sure they know that whole life  insurance is permanent and term insurance cancels. That's one goal, but it's not the main goal.  The main goal of education is to make sure they understand that term insurance is cheap  and it gives you a lot more coverage and you may not qualify for it depending on your your health.  Now we also want to stay neutral because if you're on the phone with someone who's young enough  and healthy enough and has a lot more than just final expenses to cover, well maybe there's room  term for term and whole life in this conversation, right?  So you want to try to stay neutral.  You don't want to kind of bash on term insurance if you're talking to someone who only qualifies  for whole life, but you want to give them the information in a way where they feel empowered  to make the decision themselves.  So what I have written down as an example is the best way I can explain it to you is  term insurance is temporary protection, which means it only lasts for a certain amount  of years, and then it cancels. And then you pause, right?  Posing between, between important sentences provides room for your prospect to  absorb what you just said, and maybe ask a question or provide a  statement before you move on. Way too many agents say that sentence  and without even taking a breath, they keep talking. Okay, don't make that mistake.  The second sentence says,  Term insurance also provides a higher amount of coverage  for a smaller monthly payment to protect things like,  maybe a mortgage,  or maybe you need income replacement when raising a family.  It usually covers much, much larger expenses  that aren't going to be there forever, that you could outlive.  Plus, with term insurance,  sometimes the price can even go up over time  over time, maybe every five years, which can make it unaffordable. Does that make sense?  So even the longest term insurance policies, they typically cancel by the age of 80,  and then your family's left with nothing. Pause. Let them process everything you just said  and make sure they got it, right? Does that make sense? Do you have any questions about what I just said?  So, do you see why maybe term insurance may not be the best option for you if you're  looking to cover final expenses like a burial or cremation?  And why do you agree with me about that?  I'm doubling down here because I want them to repeat back to me, which will ingrain  in their brain, that they understand what I just said, and it cements it.  Well, I wouldn't want that because, you know, I don't want to have to take the chance  about living something, and then the last few questions, like, what happens to all the money that you just paid?  Well, it would go away.  Then we move into whole life.  Now, whole life insurance is the exact opposite.  Once you're approved, the payment can never go up.  Your coverage can never go down, and it can never be canceled at any age.  These are the types of policies that people get to make sure things like their funeral costs  and final expenses are taken care of because it's permanent. Does that make sense, right? And  depending, here's the tricky part about education that you can't script. Depending on the information  you got in discovery, this is where you tie things in. So if in discovery, someone had said  that they saw an ad for, you know, $20,000 for $999 a month, I'm going to bring that information back  in in education when I talk about term. Now, you told me earlier that you saw an ad for  20,000 in coverage for $9.99 a month. More than likely, this is an example of term insurance.  More than likely, that's a teaser rate. The price would keep going up, but ultimately, it would  cancel. And if you got a proof for it, you would likely outlive it. Does that make sense?  If he had said something like, I want to cover, you know, a funeral, leave 50,000 for my wife,  leave 50,000 for my kids, and they have these unrealistic expectations about what they can get  at their age, I bring that back into education. Maybe when I talk about permanent insurance,  now you told me earlier that you were really hoping to get this much for the funeral,  this much for your wife, this much for your kids, I have to share that that might be an unreasonable  amount of coverage for us to look at if you're wanting something that's never going to cancel.  Those policies are much more expensive. So are you open to us just starting to look at the  final expenses? First, see if that's affordable, see if we can maintain that, and then maybe look at  the cost of adding additional coverage to protect your family for whatever else they might need  that money for. But likely we're probably not going to go anywhere close to the original  coverage amount that you told me today, right? So I have to bring that stuff in. I can't script  that because I don't know what they're going to say, but your job as the licensed agent is to pay  attention to those clues and bring that information back into the section that it's appropriate,  as opposed to handling it right then and there where it doesn't belong. If you want better  training like this or more detailed information or call reviews or be involved in a group where  we're always talking about this stuff, you'd have to join the team. There's only so much information  that I can give in a YouTube video but hopefully that's enough for you to have some aha moments,  some light bulb moments and be able to pay more attention to the information your clients are  giving you. Now today's video is relatively short. We talk about credibility. We try to cover  the I want to shop around objection. We talk about education. We want to make sure they have realistic  expectations about how much coverage they could get and the cost. Not just that it's permanent  in temporary. And then we move on to part four, which is figuring out how much coverage is  appropriate for them based on their needs. And I will see you next time on part four of our 10  part series of mastering the sales process.
