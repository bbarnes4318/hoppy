I know it's hard to say, but for a woman, but how much do you weigh?  I've been 50 pounds.  Non-smoker, correct?  all right. What would be if you got approved it's between right now by thirty five  forty will be a comfortable date for you to pay if you got approved.  Five is the end of my home on what it be a month. Right now we're looking at between  thirty five to forty. I'm going to aim for the third five that all the pins who takes  you. This time the beginning of the month.  Yeah.  Okay.  So we want to start at April.  Yeah, I guess.  April 1st.  We'll get you to the 1st or the 2nd, which one you prefer.  Well, the big year in the month, the first.  We're 5,000.  Okay, I got to read another disclosure for you.  All right.  So, Ignition and Company will be drafting on the 1st of April.  If you get approved, do you get information to draft?  Hi, I guess.  Yeah, so it's your basis just saying that if you do get approved  for the 5000 what's at none?  They okay to draft and if they get if you get denied they won't draft anything I continue shopping for you  I guess it's all right, I mean what can I say?  Okay, so just say I agree in which are four I agree  Can I come it person?  Okay.  Okay.  So I put it for the first week for April and they'll draft on the first.  Okay.  And how much is it?  It's going to be, how much?  Right now is looking at 37, between 37 and 40 right now.  37.  What?  $37 is going to be between $37, $40, it all depends which company improves you.  So if Newture of Omaha Approaches in the B-Round 37, that NETATES you have before you.  So I'm trying to see who's going to approve you for what?  Those numbers work for you.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Who do you think with here?  Comerica.  Thank you for America.  Comerica.  Comerica.  Comerica.  Gotcha.  Okay.  bottom of the checkbook and I have your routing and accounting. Okay? Just go on and read  it to America. I rather have you send me...shot me and send a payment in. I don't like  doing my typical phone. No, I can put you on the sand. It's the thing is, I can't take it.  I can put you on the sand. The thing is, I can't take direct bills due to the fact that  it's just for you. Why? So they're saying, I don't think of the rules or the things  God forbid if you were to die or something what happens to you they want to make sure that  the pain is not a paper or a payment and then you receive all that paperwork I think  I hear in the background you receive all that paperwork in the metal which  or policy to it so all they're going to do is just draft every month on the first  if you got a prove that it makes sense I guess I mean I have no choice I can't find my  purse. Well you can take it down you can take it down. I mean you're not approved just yet my  goal is to try to hit your prove and if you get approved nothing will come out  until the first and then you have my number and I'll set the number to kind of keep  in contact. I want to make sure I spill your daughter name right to see HRIT  I want to make sure I have your daughter name spelled right to see HRIT  I see I know no no no no  Okay, I I S T I N a okay, so rather than the C it's okay. Yeah, all right  It's T I I I can't find my purse  Okay purpose and you won't be splitting. She won't be splitting the money right you had to all go to her  Yes, I can't believe this I can't find my purse  I have another question for you, okay?  So for security purpose, what they do is they place security questions, okay?  So for instance, if you spoke to Edna, they're going to actually verify your last four  social, data birth address, but also this is a security question that she's going to have to know, okay?  So you let me know which question you want me to ask.  It's going to be either high school mascot first pet name,  Straight name that you will raise then or either mother mating name which one you want to put a straight to code for my mother's name and back to the F  B a X  T  So let's friends to  T. E. R. Okay, so if you speak to Ed and then they're gonna actually have a question that you say back to Roka. Okay, okay, you take the time  I'm gonna be finishing up some notes just a minute. What do you need now?  I just served the routing in the bottom.  This is the same thing when you give like the grass man a cut your dough.  You don't want to check.  And when you give them you hand the grass man a cut your grass you hand them a check on the bottom of those checks.  It's a routing in the counting number.  No, no, no, no.  Okay, just make sure.  Okay.  Just a minute.  You take it down.  Just a second.  One, one, one.  1 1. 2.0.  7.5.  3.  I'm going to read the number.  I'm going to read the number.  I got to repeat it for a fast because the system for safety purposes is going to delete it.  So 1 1 1 0 0 0 3 0 7.5.  3 correct.  Yes. Yes.  7.  8182.  8188.  I'm your repeater for it disappears.  7403-2.  818.  Yes.  And why can I send the payment instead of taking it directly out of my bank?  Well, what they taught us is mainly because God forbid if you did have a stroke,  or something crucial to happen to you and you can't know it then you lose the coverage.  So what they are rather do is, hey, don't worry about it. Don't worry about actually knowing the check.  We'll take care of it along as you have it and God forbid if you die and can't pay it, your daughter still can take care of it.  So there's a lot of companies that they deceased that. It's not like a light bill.  So hey, you know what, as your lights go on,  you can call back.  You know, God forbid you in a coma,  you can't send a male, but at least,  you know, for a fact, I'm pretty sure  you're on social security or disability  or any former retirement funds.  You, as we both know, you get paid on the first on the third,  that funds are free to their draft,  God forbid if you did die, your daughter still taken care.  You know, not everybody's in the position  to know a check, and unfortunately,  a few people will lose coverage if they counten on that.  So, at the end of the scene that Nietzsche Omaha  deceased at Burberry Institute that AIG  deceased that they don't long to do those things anymore.  Just for the safety, make sure they do pay out.  So it's really honestly better for you.  I know it's kind of uncomfortable  and I do have given it out, but with the check,  as you know, no one could do nothing with the check.  You write a check, you can't go to Walmart and buy anything  we're around in the county, you know what?  You can't buy anything with it.  Now, debit cards are credit cards are quite different, right?  because we could order pizza and get those numbers.  But what I've counted around, no one could buy anything with it.  And Edna's been around for 100 years.  They're legit.  I love them.  So, if Christina ever called me,  which I suggest you give her my personal number,  and God's a bit of something happened to you.  I know for a fact, Christina could take care of me  to get that 5000.  Okay.  Now, the thing is, Edna has to approve you, okay?  So, I'm gonna submit this application.  I wanna verify some things.  one of the things that I'm questioning that I have a red flag. I think I got to add  your spell wrong. So can you confirm I got 165, 7, 3, and I got E, L, C, M, I, N, O.  Yeah  Are you okay?  Yeah, I know see it slow down for me a little bit see oh  CL  Hey, I know oh  Yeah  E a  R  E a  Is that an L or O  R E a  I want to make sure you get the policy and so we got 165  I'm talking to myself. Thank you.  Okay.  Karen, can I be very honest with you, Karen?  Yes.  I honestly think just because you're going to really fast  because the computer's going to verify the address.  I'm spelling the name the street completely wrong.  Can you just slow down and just so I can make sure I got it right.  So you get the policy.  C-A-M-I-N-R...  c-A-M-I-N-R-E-A-L.  E-L-C-A-N-L.  E-L-C-A-M-I-N-O-R-E-A-L.  Got you, okay.  Is that an average street, anything like that, behind it?  Uh, there's no street on it.  It's just elk community, we go.  Okay, got it perfect.  state of taxes 77062 right?  Yes.  Perfect.  What's the city name?  Houston, Texas.  Houston, Texas, gotcha.  Just making sure I want to make sure you get the policy. That's why.  Is that the good number to reach you at?  Yes.  Okay, perfect. Do you drive care?  I don't know.  No, so you wouldn't have a state idea or drives license?  Yes, I have an ID.  Okay. Do you have that on you?  The numbers, 1, 1, 3, 6, 1, 1, 2, 0.  1, 1, 3, 6, 1, 1, 0, 0.  I don't know what.  There's not a letter in front of it.  No.  No, okay, perfect.  All right, Karen, what I'm going to do is I'm going to submit this to Eta Nuchivomal.  They're either going to say they approve you or deny you.  Okay.  Once I submit that, I'm either going to get an email.  You're going to get something in the mail.  That says they approve you as an IG, but I give you a phone call prior before that.  Okay, let's, you know, hey, Karen, they're okay.  Okay. Okay, they denied you. Let's go off with another company.  Okay.  Okay.  I'll give that.  Alright, can you do me a favor and save my-

It's going to be how much? Right now is looking at 37 between 37 and 40 right now. 37 what? 37 dollars. It's going to be between 37 dollars or $40. It all depends which company I'm trying to see who's going to approve you for what? Those numbers work for you. Okay. Okay. Who do you think with here? Comerica. Thank you for America. Comerica. Comerica. Comerica. Okay. All right. So on the bottom of the checkbook, and I have your routing and accounting. Okay. Just go on to read it to America. Hi. Okay, just go on and read it to me. I'm glad they're having a send me Shotman send the payment in. I don't like doing my typical phone No, I can put you understand it's it's the thing is an at no won't take it Not I can put you understand the thing is at no won't take direct bills Do to the fact that it's free of my turns. So they're saying it's I don't make up the rules or their things got forbid if you were to die or something what happens to you. They want to make sure that they keep the payments. They want to keep the payments. They want to keep the payments. And then you receive all that paperwork. I think I hear in the background. You receive all that paperwork in the metal which repolicy to it. So are they going to do a disaster every month on the first if you got a prove that it makes sense? I guess. I mean I have no choice, I can't find my purse. You can take it down. You can take it down. You're not approved just yet. My goal is to try to hit your prove. And if you get approved nothing would come out until the first and then you have my number and I'll set the number to kind of keep the top side. I want to make sure I spill your daughter name right to see HRIT. I want to make sure I have your daughter name spelled right to see HRIT. No, no, no, no, no. Okay, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I. Okay, so rather than the C, it's okay. Yeah, RIS. It's KRIS. I can't find my purse. Okay, perfect. And you won't be splitting. She won't be splitting the money right. You're all go to her. Yeah, I can't believe this. I can't find my purse. Can you take it time? I have another question for you, okay? So for security purpose, what they do is they place security questions, okay? So for instance, if you spoke to Edna, Uh huh. They're gonna actually verify your last four-day social data birth address, but also this is a security question there that she gonna have to know, okay? So you let me know which question one be the axe. It's gonna be either high school mascot first pet name Street name that you will raise then or eat the mother mating name, which one you want to put a security code for. My mother's been named back to the FTA. B-A-X-T-E-R. So, let's bring it to the ER. Okay. If you speak to Ed, then they're going to actually have questions that you say, back in the ER. Okay. You take the time. I'm going to be finishing up some notes. Just a minute. What'd you do now? I just serve the routing in the bottom. This is the same thing, when you give, like, the grassman. It cuts your throat. You don't want to check. Yeah, when you give them, you can. in the grassman and I cut your grass, you handle my check on the bottom of those checks is a routing in the counting number. I know! No numbers. Okay. Just make it shorter. Okay. Just a minute. Put it in. And take it down. Just a second. Oh, one, one. Two, pull, two, seven, five, three. There we have a number. I'm going to go into this. I'm going to just pair okay. But why I got a repeat of Raphazcus, the system for safety purposes is going to delete it. So 1-1-1-0-0-0-3-0-7-5-3 correct? Yes, yes. Okay. 700. 4-3-2-818. 818. 818. And you repeat a Raphazcus for it disappears. 1,500, 4,3,2,8,1,8. Yes. And why can I send a payment instead of taking it to a credit card with my bank? Well, what they taught us is mainly because God forbid if you did have a stroke, right, or something crucial what happened to you, and you can't know it then. Then you lose the coverage. Makes sense? So what they are rather do is, hey, don't worry about it. Don't worry about actually knowing the check. the check, we'll take care of it along as you have it and God forbid if you die and can't pay it, your daughter still can take care of. So there's a lot of companies that they deceased that it's not like a light bill, we'll just say, hey you know what, as your lights go off, you can call back. You know, God forbid you and a coma, you can't send a male, but at least you know, for a fact, I'm pretty sure you're on social security or disability or any former retirement funds, you as we both know you get paid on the first on a third, that funds the beat of their draft got the beat if you did die, your daughter still taken care of. You know, not everybody's in the position to know a check. And unfortunately, a few people will lose coverage if they count on them. So, at the end of the scene that Nietzsche Omaha deceased that, verb or excuse that AIG to cease that, they don't long to do those things anymore. Just for the safety, they make sure they do pay out. So, it's really honestly better for you. I know it's kind of uncomfortable and I do have given it out. But with the check, as you know, no one could do nothing with a check. You write a check, you can't go to Walmart and buy anything or around you or an accounting. You know, you can't buy anything with it. Now, debit cards are credit cards a quite different right, because we could order pizza and get those numbers. But what a counter-around, no one could buy anything with it. And at least been around for 100 years, they're legit. I love them. So if Christina ever called me, which I suggest you give her my personal number, and go out to bed as something happened to you, I know for a fact, Christina could take care from BABG at that 5000. Okay. Now the thing is, I have to approve you, okay. So I'm going to submit this application. I want to verify some things. One of the things that I'm questioning that I have a red flag. I think I got to add this spell wrong. So can you confirm I got 165, 73, and I got E, L, C, M, I, N, O. Yeah Are you okay? E L C a M I N O C is slowed down for me a little bit C L C L C A M I N O R E A L E A L R E A L Is that an L or O R E A L I want to make sure you get the policy So we got 165 five. That is the real. She's done, she's done. She's done again. Oh, I'm talking to myself. Thank you. Noko. Karen, can I be very honest with you, Karen? Yes. I honestly think just because you're going to really fast because the computer is going to verify the address. I'm spelling the name the street completely wrong. Can you just slow down and just so I can make sure I got it right so you get the policy? Yeah. L. C-A-M-I-N-R. C-A-M-I-N-O. R-E-A-L. E-L-C-A-L. C-A-M-I-N-O. R-E-A-L. Got you, okay. Is that an average grid anything like that behind it? It doesn't, there's no street on it. It's just elk community out of. Okay, got it perfect. state of taxes 77062 right? Yes. Perfect. What's the city name? Houston, Texas. Houston, Texas, gotcha. Just making sure I want to make sure you get the policy. That's why. Is that the good number to reach you at? Yes. Okay, perfect. Do you drive Karen? I know. No. So you wouldn't have a state idea or drives license? Yes, I have an ID. Okay. Do you have that on you? The numbers, 1, 1, 3, 6, 1, 1, 2, 0. 1, 1, 1, 3, 6, 1, 1, 0, 0. Is not a letter in front of it? No. No, okay, perfect. Alright, Karen, what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna submit this to Eta, Eta, and Muchivoma Hall. They're either gonna say they approve you or deny you. Okay. Once I submit that, I'm either gonna get an email, you're gonna get something in the mail, that says they approve you as an IG, but I give you a phone call prior before that. Okay, let you know, hey, Karen, you agree? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll give that. Alright, can you do me a favor and save my-
