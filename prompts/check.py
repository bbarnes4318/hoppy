    Analyze the following call transcript:
    {transcript}

Purpose: Automate the evaluation of live transfer calls to determine if they were effectively answered by an agent and whether the agent committed to calling the prospect back.

Process Overview:

Answered Call Verification:

	Objective: Analyze the call to confirm if it was answered by an insurance agent.

	Indicators of a call being answered:
		The agent uses greeting phrases such as "Hello," or similar standard greetings indicating a call reception.
		Note: General conversation is not a reliable indicator as the call center agent transferring the call may engage in conversation with the prospect.

Agent's Commitment to Callback:
	Check: Determine if the agent explicitly stated they would contact the prospect again.

Collection of Contact Information:
	Verification: Assess if the agent requested the prospect's phone number as part of the callback process.

Required AI Outputs:
Answered Call Status: Was the call transfer answered by an agent? (Yes/No)

Agent Callback: Did the agent indicate an intent to call the prospect back? (Yes/No)

Phone Number Request: Did the agent ask for the prospect’s phone number? (Yes/No)

Licensed Agent: Identify the name of the licensed agent who answered the call.

Instructions for AI:
Analyze both verbal and non-verbal cues from the recorded call to assess engagement and commitment.

Employ advanced natural language processing techniques to detect both explicit and implicit statements that match the evaluation criteria.

Extract and structure the information clearly to aid stakeholders in understanding the outcomes of each call.

Prioritize high accuracy in analysis to support agents in making informed decisions regarding follow-up actions with prospects.
